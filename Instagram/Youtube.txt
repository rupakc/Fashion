<0,null>	Laurie, in a parallel Universe not discovered by scientists until thirty years from now you and I are soulmates.....just kidding but hey if the doctor told me I had a week to live..I would want to polish your heels for the rest of my life.? 
<0,null>	What kind of jeans does the guy have on before the 7 jeans 
<1,0>	i&#39;m 5&#39;11 tall my waist is 31-32 , size 30 on my True Religion jean fit me good , what size should i buy on 7 For All Mankind ? do they runs bigger like True Religion ? 
<1,0>	Wondering should I get size 33 or 34?  
<1,0>	I&#39;ve tried the slimmy slim staring 
<1,-1>	who would wear this expensive shit. boot cut is so ugly 
<1,0>	I&#39;m here for the bootys~ 
<1,-1>	These jeans are gay as fuck 
<1,-1>	@zablauja if ur wearing girls k=jeans i dont care why, ur still a faggot 
<1,0>	@zablauja buy seven skinny jeans they fit like women jeans if ur slim and have cooler desgins 
<1,0>	I have a question (and I know it might be a stupid one) but...what is the difference between &quot;fitted through the thigh&quot; and &quot;slim through the thigh&quot;? Are they just two ways of saying the same thing? 
<1,0>	Those girls are fine. Hmmmm 
<1,-1>	My sevens don&#39;t have any of those pockets. 
<0,null>	nice ass =P 
<0,null>	those r some nice ass 
<0,null>	I bet the guy behind these jeans would rather sell seven kinds instead of two, because it the way of the Samarai, Pffttt... 
<1,-1>	Ya&#39; know....it&#39;s called 7 For Mankind....but I have seen no dude sizes/styles yet.....waste of my time lol 
<0,null>	i love chicks asses they look really sexy in a gud pair of jeans 
<0,null>	That model is hot! 
<1,-1>	I have 9 pairs of sevens and they are all womans also i like the fit better than guys jeans that have crotches hanging down to my knees thats what i call crap 
<1,1>	i heve 18 Pair of seven Jeans and i am a guy ,most OF all are womans they fit perfect on slim guys like me , its an addiction I WANT MORE!

<0,null>	Does any one know how to tell fake Louis Vuitton men jeans 
<0,null>	Those are 2 different fucking brands. 
<1,-1>	OMG!!! I just bought a fake pair!! Holly Shit!! Damn it!! 
<1,0>	I live in a country where we copy jeans so well that not even the retailers can see a difference, we send them to Paris and they sell for top dollar, anything can be copied believe me. 
<0,null>	Who cares their just clothes. Besides the govt does really care about you. All they want is your money. They will tax you to death. 
<1,-1>	Uninformed videos like this help keep the public in the dark about jeans authentication. If you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, don&#39;t go making expert authentication videos. Don&#39;t go around trying to educate people about identifying &quot;fake designer jeans&quot; when you clearly don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. I hope Seven7 sues you for implying their brand are fakes of Seven for all Mankind. That&#39;s clearly factually incorrect and damaging to their business reputation. 
<1,-1>	Wow. Even if this video was not comparing apples to oranges (being that Seven7&#39;s are not counterfeit 7 For All Mankinds, and simply a totally different brand!), the points being made as to what to use to authenticate 7FAM&#39;s are totally erroneous. It is thoroughly false that all 7FAM&#39;s have striped pocket linings, for example, and the tags on pairs going back many years now are totally different, do not have the security strip in the same location, etc etc etc. Totally uneducated video. 
<1,-1>	This video is completely misleading and inaccurate. Seven7 and 7 For All Mankind are completely different brands. This video does not show how to accurately authenticate 7 For All Mankind jeans. 
<1,0>	@DVBS1010 I agree. Seven7 jeans are not imitations of 7 For All Mankind. They are simply two different brands. 
<1,0>	she&#39;s confusing. 
<0,null>	I know your kinda old but did you ever did anal? 
<0,null>	When she was wearing the glasses she looks like selena gomez! 
<0,null>	im 13 and 5,5 
<0,null>	love the intro!!! so cute!! 
<0,null>	you look REALLY pretty in this vid&lt;3 
<0,null>	Wow, you look so small in your videos, and then you said your pants were a size three, I&#39;m a size three too, and that made me feel really good:) thanks Meghan:) 
<0,null>	LOLLLLL the thumbnail kills me 
<1,0>	Maybe it&#39;s just me, but the Blue My Mind trio eyeshadow, but the first color she called, &quot; baby blue &quot; looks white to me... Just me? 
<0,null>	you can pull off any lip color 
<0,null>	I LIVE IN LAS VEGAS ! &lt;33 
<0,null>	Dear God, in my next life, can I have Meghan&#39;s hair? Thanks. 
<0,null>	Does anyone eles think that meghan looks like nathalia ramos?

<1,0>	@BeautyAlAdin Thank you! I just need to see swatches first, promo photos really don&#39;t get me excited! I need some legit temptalia review before I&#39;ll buy something :) But the surf baby blush looks pretty! 
<1,-1>	Sup Alex. In your opinion, which would be the types of fits or washes in 7fam&#39;s brand that would make someone appear as homosexual? Of course, I know they&#39;re all for everyone to wear, but if you could help me out with an honest answer it&#39;d be awesome! Love your vids. 
<1,1>	I love them very much the bootcut, I may suggest sizing down. I got mine in 38 waist and there are kinda big, Ive lost a bunch of weight since then and now they are falling off of me!

<1,0>	I think skinny jeans can be for all but if it is for larger size girls, it is better to style it with heels, the taller, the better!=]

<0,null>	Hi April.Â  I see that you said you use the new toothbrush Justin purchased you.Â  I was wondering which do you like better the new oral b toothbrush or the dazzlepro.Â  I was thinking of purchasing the dazzlepro.? 
<0,null>	Nice stuff...I like most of them you two mentioned.? 
<0,null>	April be careful of receding gums! I was warned of this too from my dentist. Once they recede, they never come back or regenerate. =[? 
<0,null>	You guys- make sure the corn kernels you buy are ORGANIC so that you&#39;ll know they&#39;re non-GMO. GMO foods are really not healthy to eat, and something like 90% of corn now is GMO. Really avoid it at all costs!Â <br />That&#39;s awesome you&#39;re popping your own popcorn. Microwaving isn&#39;t good either, so this popcorn maker is really actually good for you! Popcorn can be a very nice, light snack depending on what you put on it :) mmmmmmmm fresh popcorn <b>drool</b>? 
<0,null>	you guys are adorable? 
<0,null>	Hi April and Justin! You guys always have the best favorites! April that mixer looks amazing! Lots of love! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3? 
<0,null>	I&#39;m also a hard brusher? 
<0,null>	you guys have so many appliances and kitchen gadgets! lolÂ ? 
<0,null>	Best toaster oven recipe ever: English muffin, topped with avocado, a slice of fresh tomato and a tsp of shredded cheese. Sprinkle on sea salt and toasted sesame seeds, then toast til cheese melts. It&#39;s delicious! My Eccos are one of my favorite pairs of shoes I own. And try popping your popcorn in a tsp of bacon grease. OMG Justin will have major foodgasm face. Lol! :-)<br />? 
<0,null>	How exciting!!? 
<0,null>	You guys are made for each other.what a perfect couple.? 
<0,null>	always love watching your random his and her favorites :) something to look forward every month? 
<0,null>	Justin you should definitely check up a book called Pregnancy For Men: The whole nine months. My partner found it very helpful but at the same time it has a lot of humour in it about the hormonal and scary wife&#39;s and how to handle that haha. Check it out!? 
<0,null>	you two are so cute i love watching april and the two of you are so inspiring Â i love your union as a family Â  Â God is in it Â  Â love you two Â  justin you are so supportive and loving april how lucky and blessed Â  my fav for sure Â  congrats on the new addition liamÂ ? 
<0,null>	The tootbrush is amazing April haha? 
<0,null>	That is a sharp car, I am the same way when we get a new car I am into the electronic options. I never knew that your last car was a convertible, it was nice too!? 
<0,null>	I am telling, Justin I have told you about that OptiGrill by Tfal it is the best indoor grill it has setting for every kind of meat and it sensors how thick it is. Also you can manually set it too. Check it out, Pat? 
<0,null>	That is the coolest wine chiller I have ever seen!? 
<0,null>	You should try making the popcorn with coconut oil! You can find it at trader joes or any super market or health food store! It hardly tastes like coconut but it tastes like butter and I just add a bit of salt and it&#39;s amazingggg!!!! Let me know if you try it!!(:? 
<0,null>	I just love u two! Such genuine, happy people!? 
<0,null>	My dad always grinded his coffee beans. I remember staying at my parents when I was pregnant (my husband was out of town for college class) and waking up to the aroma of that coffee grinding :) Loved this video! ? 
<0,null>	A lot of different studies have shown that during pregnancy the body&#39;s release of hormones increases the level of inflammatory mediators that are higher than usual which can lead to tissue aggravation in the gums and could result in pregnancy periodontitis. Also diabetes can have a similar effect on the gums as well :)Â <br />-2nd yr dental studentÂ ? 
<0,null>	Very informative and useful favorites!! Thank you. I really enjoy the way you two work together with giving info and explaining things. April, I love your ability to make us &quot;feel/see/smell&quot; etc whatever it is you&#39;re describing, that&#39;s a gift you gave! And Justin, I truly appreciate your intelligent and well informed descriptions and explanations of things, how they work, what works and doesn&#39;t work about them etc. between the two of you I feel I truly understand the products you&#39;ve introduced us to. LOVE!!? 
<0,null>	He has such a sweet smile? 
<0,null>	You guys are so amazing ! Always positive and grateful :) I love your videos xx? 
<0,null>	Man I used to brush really hard before I had braces, and now I am afraid of brushing too hard b/c I am afraid my rubber bands will snap and the brackets will come off lol, but I am just waiting to get my braces off. I can&#39;t wait to try lipsticks on; you have a beautiful lip color on you btw:) &lt;3? 
<0,null>	OMG APRIL IN ONE OF YOUR RESENT VLOGS YOU GUYS WERE EATING PIZZA BAGEL YOU HAVE TO TRY THEM IN YOU TOASTER OVER YOU WONT REGRET IT LOL<br />? 
<0,null>	I do daily Vlogs and film other videos but I only use my Canon Elph PowerShot. I want to upgrade for better quality video but I don&#39;t have the budget for a camera that is 1,000, like most of the good ones are. Would you recommend this camera for filming videos when just starting out as well? You guys are so great with making good quality vides, editing, and uploading regularly. I&#39;d love some advice...from Justin lol ;-)Â ? 
<0,null>	The lighting is way too bright in these videos? 
<0,null>	Justin I tried sriracha for the first time this week because of you. I was at a restaurant and the bartender was walking by with it, I said I didn&#39;t know you had that here he said we don&#39;t &#39;it&#39;s the bars stash&#39;. He gave me a little to try with my fish and i dont know why but I was not expecting it to be spicy let alone THAT spicy. It was good and I like spicy food but as I get older my body can&#39;t &#39;handle it&#39; anymore if you catch my drift lol. You must have a stomach of steel lol. He did say that it&#39;s no longer available in CA, is this true? And if so do you order it online now? I live in Philly and he said something about them storing it in a warehouse in pa because we have the space. ? 
<0,null>	Hi guys, love it so much when you share your favorites! It&#39;s like reading consumer&#39;s report but I don&#39;t have to read I just watch and listen to you guys.

<1,0>	Hi April. I have a question. Hope this isn&#39;t too personal but I was wondering what size you got in the genie bra? I went on Amazon and the only sizes available are Med, Large, XLarge, XXLarge... I was going to order a medium but I hope it&#39;s not too big. I&#39;m a 34B. And I hate returning stuff by mail. It&#39;s a PIA! Lol. ? 
<0,null>	I love to watch your videos!! ? 
<0,null>	Justin&#39;s modeling is so funny!! Lol? 
<1,0>	Hi April, I brought a Genie bra at Bed Bath and Beyond. Very comfortable.? 
<0,null>	Brushing too hard can be bad on your enamel too! D:? 
<0,null>	You are the best? 
<0,null>	Why are so many of your links to amazon? ? 
<1,0>	LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Genie Bra&#39;s!!!!? 
<1,1>	I love watching your videos guys! You are such an insipiration to be better and be good to loved ones. I really hope one day I find someone to be as happy with as you guys are!? 
<1,1>	Try the Rockport dress shoes as well. My husband has to go dressy for work every day and loves those shoes because they are extremely comfortable! :)? 
<0,null>	The sonicare will actually stop moving if you brush too hard. My brushing habits have improved so much from a toothbrush upgrade.? 
<0,null>	Oooooh Justin. Those are some hoe down modeling skillz!! You crack me up! LOL ? 
<1,1>	You guys are too cute! Love you videos !? 
<1,0>	Hahaha Justin dancing in those jeans was hilarious! Great video you guys. :)? 
<0,null>	Hi Justin<br /><br />Here are a few books to check outÂ <a 
<0,null>	You look so beautiful and glowing now.. The pregnancy makes you more glow and radiant April!? 
<1,0>	April you should try the Genie Leggings !! ? 
<1,1>	Excellent picks guys!! The thingy for the wine looks amazingð? 
<1,0>	You guys need to check out Joe&#39;s Jeans, we are having our End of Season sale so all clothing is 30-50% off! If you go to an outlet you can get a pair of $200 jeans for $30-35!!! Tell them Taylor from Livermore sent you :) ? 
<0,null>	April we are toothbrush twinsies I have the same one ;) I love the little red light that comes on! &amp; it makes such a difference in how clean my teeth feel because of the tiny little brush head!? 
<1,1>	April you talked about the genie bra so much that I wanted to try it so I got one for Christmas and I have to say I really love it! I wouldn&#39;t have tried it otherwise so thank you for reviewing it!! you and Justin are my favorite I look for your vlogs first thing when I get on youtube! love you guys, and baby Liam &lt;3? 
<0,null>	Just to let you know there is no links showing up mobile devises. There&#39;s nothing in the down bar :(? 
<0,null>	Great Favorites guys! Thanks for sharing! You two always make my day xoxo? 
<0,null>	You should try the oral-b 5000 toothbrush! I have it and i think it is the upgraded version of yours and i love it so much! You should really try it ?

<0,null>	I love you guys , so awesome ? 
<0,null>	Justin, did you dye your hair? It looks soooo much darker. Maybe it&#39;s just me...? 
<0,null>	You guys are so cute! I loved hearing about your favorites, especially the kitchen things. My Kitchen Aid mixer is one of my favorite things!? 
<0,null>	I honestly need to let you know that I love watching your videos! They&#39;re so positive and I truly go away feeling wonderful. Thank you so much :)? 
<0,null>	<br />Ya in east coast we have organic eggs for up to 2.1 ounces, they are pretty heavy ð? 
<0,null>	One recommendation for your toothbrush, my dentist actually recommended the Phillips Sonicare one. He says that toothbrushes that spin aren&#39;t good for your gums either. The Sonicare one is ultrasonic and doesn&#39;t spin. I&#39;ve used both and I prefer the sonic one for my gums cause I have the same problem.? 
<0,null>	My favorites have been my heated blanket. It&#39;s important to have in the winter and living in Minnesota. My husband favorite has been his wart removal. He had a wart on the bottom of his foot and its been helping so very much ? 
<0,null>	Lol! I&#39;m a hard Brusher too! I need that brush. Keep making awesome videos!<br />? 
<0,null>	updated macaroon vid!!!? 
<0,null>	I love this video! I like that y&#39;all included kitchen gadgets ð ?

<0,null>	I died when Justin modeled the jeans with the two kicks ... hahaa...you guys are hilarious? 
<1,1>	7 jeans are the best theyre my faveÂ ? 
<0,null>	I like these kinds of videos they are different. Justin is so funny dancing with his new pant&#39;s.? 
<0,null>	I need a new stand mixer. I really like that soft yellow color.? 
<0,null>	I love that you guys included kitchen gadgets as well as clothing in your haul. Â I would love that wine warmer/cooler. Â I need to find one, and the coffee grinder and the toothbrush LOL, I guess I like everything ;)? 
<0,null>	Hi April and Justin.. i absolutely loved this video but wished u had done it before xmas as the Wine Chiller/warmer would have been an awesome present for my hubby ;) lol but I also like surprising him with little gifts for no reason and this one he would absolutely Love!! So thank you for sharing :) Also, the toaster oven and popcorn maker is awesome!! We stopped using a microwave for over 6 years as they are VERY unhealthy; and we realized that it didn&#39;t seem &#39;right&#39; to reheat/cook with &#39;radiation&#39;.. so now we just use our oven and for popcorn we use a big ol&#39; pot, grapeseed oil and kernels and cook it till it pops! So much healthier and even tastes very yummy!! I only use a very little amount of the grapeseed oil and 1/4 of kernels and it makes the whole pot!! ;) So if ever your maker retires you can always fall back to a good ol pot lol Also I use and old one and not one of my expensive ones because the oil does eventually over time stain the pot... Anyhow.. all your items are awesome!! Thank you for sharing :) Have a wonderful night!! P.S: Thank you for listing the links in the description box, it&#39;s very helpful! As April would say &quot; Thank you Kindly&quot; (would love a tank top that says that *cough cough hint hint) ;) ? 
<0,null>	I have a gift for you and baby Liam but I haven&#39;t been able to send it yet I&#39;m still with family. Hopefully sometime during this week though!!? 
<0,null>	When u guys show the products up close the picture is really clear but when its you two on the couch its really pixely and just the picture isnt the best. Hopefully it isnt just me. But i love u guys? 
<0,null>	April how do you wash you bras so that the pads dont get ruined .. I bought some at walmart.. And they always get ruined..i tried by hand and in the washer and nothing :(? 
<1,1>	Justin, my fiancÃ© use to wear cheaper jeans as well and now he won&#39;t wear anything besides sevens. They fit so well and they last forever! April, I have a problem with brushing my teeth too hard too! I&#39;ll have to look into that toothbrush:). You guys always put a smile on my face. Thanks for the video!? 
<0,null>	April you and I are both aggressive brushers....what a great gift and idea!! ? 
<0,null>	You guys always put a huge smile on my face, April, I make the same noise as u wen I get excited about something hehehe :) x? 
<0,null>	That&#39;s so awesome that your car has a hotspot built in. That&#39;s something that I need. Cause I&#39;m always traveling. And don&#39;t want to use all my data.? 
<0,null>	When u showed the popcorn maker u can see justin go in a circle ? 
<0,null>	I love yoU guys soooo much ;p?

<0,null>	Love this kind of video? 
<0,null>	I had the popcorn maker. You&#39;re supposed to put the butter on the top part with the lid on while the popcorn pops. But after a while the machine broke :( ? 
<0,null>	If u want another way to get your wine cool is to put frozen grapes in it ? 
<0,null>	those puffy mints they are my favorite glad to see im not the only one that has them everywhere i put them in my purse lol and school bag :)? 
<0,null>	Love u guys ? 
<0,null>	Thank you guys for your card!!?

<0,null>	My misc. monthly is Nashi Pears. I don&#39;t know if they are in season there or if they ship them--I am pretty new to my seasons being in reverse[sorry] they are in season here in New Zealand. I just tried them for the first time recently, but honestly I am obsessed! Half-way between an apple and a pear but really lite like watermelon. Such a great snack for one of your fruits for the day. 
<0,null>	Well since someone asked about paint color what is your main living area it? I love it, I think it is just what I have been looking for. 
<0,null>	I can&#39;t remember if I&#39;ve heard Griege but I think I have but haven&#39;t not in quite a while. That really struck my funny; maybe it was how you said it--sort of pulled it out of nowhere. That is the sort of weird humor I get a kick out of. I am originally from the midwest and I think that is why I am enjoying you so much--I have been really homesick [I&#39;m all the way downunder in New Zealand if you haven&#39;t caught that already sniff sniff.] and you cheer me up. Thanks Jen! 
<0,null>	Oops, accidentally hit enter. Was saying no need to apologize for watching tv, I love my shows too. Also bummed about Smash, will miss it! 
<0,null>	That was great, thanks for always being so willing to share! Btw, no need fapologies 
<1,0>	Hi Jen Your vlogs are amazing... so are you!!! So glad I found your Busy Bee Chanel... I have been enjoying your housewifelife channel! Great work! Your videos make my days! Thank you 
<0,null>	I have an allergy to Gluten so I am so excited to hear about the protein powder. I am going to try it. 
<0,null>	I think it&#39;s pronounced like Jillian because I had a professor named Gillian and she pronounced it Jillian. 
<0,null>	I suggest you listen to the cover of Locked out of heaven from Tyler Ward. Amazing. :D 
<0,null>	Does the chocolate flavoring cover up the coconut flavor of the coconut water? I just tried the regular and can&#39;t get past that sort of earthy flavor it has. I&#39;m going to try mixing it up in a smoothie, but if I can just get the chocolate one and drink it straight, that would be great! 
<0,null>	://clicks2offer.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=48&amp;aff_id=4720 
<0,null>	I love her! What a lovely compliment :) 
<0,null>	The bedroom is painted in Northern Air by Benjamin Moore...it&#39;s much lighter. 
<0,null>	I&#39;ve been thinking of doing that! Going to start with May :) 
<0,null>	I&#39;ll eventually do a bookshelf organization video on OLJ :) 
<1,1>	Thanks! I&#39;ve been in a total purple mood late...May Favorites spoiler? 
<0,null>	Chocolate Zico is SO good! :o) 
<0,null>	the Counting Crows August and Everything After -- Love it...every song is sooo good! Music for the soul indeed 
<0,null>	It&#39;s funny - I was thinking about the scents from different candles clashing, and you discussed it in today&#39;s video! I wondered if you always burned the same ones in your office, rather than different ones... Thanks for sharing! 
<0,null>	Didn&#39;t know your from Chicago!! Yay!!! 
<0,null>	Woohoo for living in PA! 
<0,null>	You look like Jennifer Garner ... 
<0,null>	pls don&#39;t lipsinc again - that was terrifying! i had to skip that whole section ::shudder:: 
<0,null>	great video Jenn! Do your Dansko shoes run true to size?? 
<0,null>	I loved the music favorites part of your video, you literally made me laugh out loud because that&#39;s exactly what I look like when I sing 
<0,null>	I use to walk to school and passed by honey suckle and my sisters and I use to love the liquid it produced. it was sweet. 
<0,null>	You look so pretty! I like your shirt color and lip color in this video. :) 
<0,null>	Hey beautiful lady! Is your bedroom the same color as your office? Lazy Sunday by Benjamin Moore. The reason I am asking is that I made a HUGE mistake when I painted my bedroom and am looking for another color. I am being nosey, but did you work with a designer? I want to compliment your home, you have exquisite taste. xxx 
<0,null>	August and Everything After is probably one of the best albums ever made!! SO happy it was part of your favorites this month!!! 
<0,null>	I agree with your comments and was noticing that I had that same profile pic as my Facebook pic! Love her! 
<0,null>	Love my Weather Bug! Use it all the time! 
<0,null>	I have the same Dansko clogs in black and a NorthFace fleece in purple and live in them as well. 
<0,null>	Winnie looks dead! Hope it isn&#39;t heatstroke! 
<0,null>	It would be awesome if you started to feature a youtuber of the month, or someone&#39;s videos you&#39;ve been really enjoying! 
<0,null>	I was wondering about your cell phone case....it is adorable!! Yes Dansko clogs are the best!! Love the favorites this month..you rock Jen!! 
<0,null>	Jen, Love Bruno Mars too. It&#39;s all because of YOU!! LOL. anyhow, next book you might like Amanda Hockings book series. similar to the second book you showed here. Love the spring makeup. Tutorial soon?? Love you! 
<0,null>	can you do a book collection video or did I miss that you did one? and how you store them and where etc,? would be great to see thanks!! 
<0,null>	Your lip synching and dancing in this video solidifies itself that you are my favorite person on youtube! Hugs from sunny Cali! 
<0,null>	Purple really suits you! You look amazing. Goes with your complexion beautifully - im so fair/pink i dream of wearing purple, lol. 
<0,null>	Okay you win. Good Day............... 
<0,null>	I tried out the Zico chocolate coconut water because you have been mentioning it so much in your blogs. I have been wanting a healthier option for chocolate milk as a treat and with this drink I found it. I&#39;m not into protein shakes but the Zico tastes like YooHoo to me which is awesome! 
<0,null>	Hi Jen - good choice on Counting Crows, high school flashback for me! I would agree with you, hard to pick a fav, but when the mood strikes me a bit mushy, Raining in Baltimore does it for me! 
<0,null>	actually you are making a big deal .. not her 
<1,1>	Great video:) 
<1,1>	Great video! You are so enjoyable to watch! 
<0,null>	Great Video!! Give Winnie a kiss. 
<0,null>	I love Bruno mars 
<0,null>	I love BBW spring candle! 
<0,null>	Fun to hear favorites, My current music is Josh Groban&#39;s All that Echoes, candle scent B&amp;BW&#39;s Pink Sangria, current handbag Coach well forgot the name but it&#39;s pink, red, yellow and white interlinking C&#39;s, book 2 lined up ready to go are Les Mis and The Bhagavad Gita .... 
<0,null>	Not at all, she just mentions it almost every vlog and makes a big deal over nothing, so I was voicing my opinion, or comment as it is stated above COMMENTS, no more no less. 
<0,null>	weather issues much? 
<0,null>	Would you please STOP about Chicago weather! I&#39;ve lived here my whole life and that&#39;s pretty long and 75 or 80 is NOT HOT like you did mention last VLOG! It&#39;s May yes it&#39;s Spring our weather is usually about 65 as normal and yes sometimes goes to 75 or 80 and sometimes down to about 55, so gheez it&#39;s not that funny! Just had to point that out you were driving me crazy with that! Plus you live on the lake, so you have cooler weather than the rest of us in this area. 
<0,null>	Your Misc Monthlies are my favorite in your monthly videos. Thanks for sharing! 
<1,1>	Love these videos.. Thank you For sharing. 
<0,null>	LOVE LOVE LOVE Bruno Mars! :-) 
<1,1>	I love watching your videos. You are so much fun. LOL :) 
<0,null>	Loved Desperate Housewives :) 
<1,0>	yes purple my fav...looking fresh out of highschool 
<0,null>	Aw, thanks! I&#39;m so cheesy ;) 
<0,null>	I did show the bag in my March Misc Monthlies :) 
<1,0>	Wow, again? Lots of sales this spring for BBW! 
<0,null>	I love filming them! :o) 
<1,1>	SO good! 
<1,0>	Exactly! :) 
<0,null>	Great lip sync you always make me smile. Thanks for sharing. 
<0,null>	I know it&#39;s spring when I see the yellow bedspread in the background..haha! I&#39;ve been digging Body Shop&#39;s Coconut body butter (I get compliments every time I leave my house with it on) and my Scentsy&#39;s candles and plug ins. I&#39;ve moved away from B&amp;BW candles because of the ingredients that I might be allergic to. I love the purple color and lipstick color. I love how your makeup look is evolving and how you&#39;re coming into your own style wise. Happy Spring Jen! 
<0,null>	jen im so happy you featured anthropology candle! bbw candles could be seen in all beauty guru videos! im glad you put a different brand. bbw is boring an could be seen in gurus! im happy yours is different, excited for more unique finds from you! love your videos 
<0,null>	you got me into gossip girl.!I love that show! 
<0,null>	I think you pronounce it as if it was spelled with a J.. A friend of mine spells it and pronounces it that way. When she shortens it she uses the J for Jill. 
<0,null>	The little eggs on your nails are so cute! :D 
<0,null>	So funny- lol!!! I have been watching only one show- RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race - my mom watches it too. and the food I gave been living on is Trader Joe Cilantro hummus. I live that you ask because I love reading comment responses :-) 
<1,1>	Love your makeup! 
<1,1>	You are just so cute, I love watching your videos :) 
<0,null>	Your lipcolor looks so nice on you! You look bright and all lit up inside! 
<0,null>	What lip color are you wearing? 
<0,null>	Seriously, that is so rude. Noone asked for her two cents on Jens &quot;greasy hair&quot;. 
<1,0>	wish you had shown your handbag... 
<0,null>	Love your new camera and editing!!!! 
<0,null>	2 for 22 candles at bath and body works this weekend! 
<0,null>	Jen-your springtime bedspread set is such a pretty color of yellow! 
<0,null>	&quot;and rita says shes dyin, by the front door hear her crying, why? i dont know - round here. we always stand up straight.&quot; i love the part when it goes something about Jesus and Elvis. lol. it sounds weird but im serious. and so are they. i was singing round here with you! (: last month, i was totally surprised in your taste in music. it is just like mine. i love counting crows. i have never heard the whole cd though. i will have to check it out. 
<0,null>	Love the new editing features. They added al lot to your videos 
<0,null>	I love all of your videos, but the miscellaneous monthlies are the ones i look forward to the most. 
<0,null>	i love your positive energy ! you made my day . 
<0,null>	I love Bruno Mars &quot;locked out of heaven&quot; that is definitely my happy song. 
<0,null>	I think she was sleeping... :) 
<0,null>	Really...why are some people so rude. I know you are going to say you are just &quot;trying to help&quot; or that you &quot;only care about her&quot;. But come on, that is rude! I guess some people were never taught, &quot;If you don&#39;t have something nice to say, say nothing at all.&quot; 
<0,null>	You&#39;re so funny Jen, never change! I love your videos! :) 
<0,null>	I just wanted to say I really love your videos. I am only twenty and a junior in university( senior in a couple of weeks), but we are very similar. I have really bad chronic anxiety(GAD) and insomnia. I so go to therapy for both. My anxiety has caused my ocd to come out, a side effect besides the insomnia. I have found such comfort and therapy in all of your videos on all your channels. I just wanted to say thank you and to please keep doing videos. 
<0,null>	Anthropology has the BEST candles. I haven&#39;t shopped bath and body in many years, 
<0,null>	Hi Jen, i returned to work after a month off sick, so got back into my routine. Clothes wise it was the same as March as it is only now in May that spring is sprunging in Ireland.I did purchase a lovely spring scarf, forget me not blue with a little white design detail. I rewatched The Tudor series (love it) Got into Fleur De Force Vlogs (via you :-)) And also enjoying Don&#39;s utube videos. Got back into my Weight Watchers routine and purchased the protracker app which is very handy. Happy Mayx 
<1,0>	Love the dancing! Made me giggle. 
<0,null>	You touch your hair so much and that&#39;s why it looks greasy on you sometimes. I used to do that too and my friendly advice to you is to STOP cause you end up making it look way worse than it is, and it&#39;s a shame cause you invest in your hair and in making it look good and stay healthy. 
<0,null>	That bracelet you wear on the plane is kind of like having &quot;worry beads&quot; !! If it comforts you that&#39;s a good thing :) 
<1,0>	haha i just figured out who it is when you started talking about jeans. show your shoes adian

<1,0>	Hey, just curious when did you purchase those jeans? 
<1,1>	Please watch my video and vote - are my jeans real or fake? Thanks! 
<1,0>	@ShinmaRyuu You do get funny looks but I tell them sometimes im buying for my wife, sister, friend, girlfriend ect. Thanks for watching! 
<1,0>	I have a female friend and my mom that i go to garage sales with. They are both in on the game and it makes buying stuff for women a tad less awkward :P. I have got those odd looks though buying toys before though since i am an adult male lol. 
<1,1>	Thanks for the tips! I&#39;ll have to keep an eye out for jeans now. Slim pickin&#39;s up here in Jersey too. Did find a few things though. Nice sales w/ your tea set and the book! Heather 
<1,0>	@bluegeno You already have Chris! Thanks! 
<1,0>	This is a perfect example of why I love this &quot;thing of ours&quot;... I am learning something to put in my arsenal of info to use when I am out buying. Thanks for another awesome video. I hope I can return the favor! 
<1,1>	@turboman8082 Oh yeah maybe start at 20 with the nwt, you hit a gold mine there. I learned that the return policy is super important with jeans. Check out how I list mine and others so you wont have to take a return if the item doesnt fit. Since they are new you might be able to get away with a &quot;no returns&quot; policy. Im happy for you man! 
<1,1>	@turboman8082 I LOVE Lucky Brand jeans, they sell all day at $11.00-15.00 If the Liz Claiborne are white you are in real good shape. I would buy them for a buck and sell them for 10-11 sometimes more. I am weak on the shirts but from what ive seen womens tops from her go for about the same price. The current tops and dresses sell well the older ones maybe not so much. Good luck and thanks for commenting 
<0,null>	@222222snoopy Ditto, thanks! 
<1,1>	I&#39;ve never heard of that brand name. I love the info I get from your channel! Thanks for sharing! 
<0,null>	@bernieefran Lilo and stich quote, obviously from Stitch! hahhaha :) Aww thank you! 
<0,null>	Hi Tiffany! Â I actually also love your extra credit card holder and main cc and money holder. Â Where can we find those?? 
<1,1>	Thanks Tiffany for doing a review. I really love the bag. Thinking I might get a mini one first now for Christmas. Thinking I will stick with classic black.? 
<1,1>	I always loved your videos, glad you&#39;re back!? 
<1,1>	I love the color. Is it cavier or lamb skin?? 
<1,1>	Ugh I love that color! And I&#39;m glad to see you back Tiffany! ? 
<1,0>	SO glad you are back!? 
<1,0>	Review on my Chanel Mini Flap!Â  Hope this is helpful to anyone wanting to purchase this bag or just wanting to see more details on it.?

<0,null>	Hi April.Â  I see that you said you use the new toothbrush Justin purchased you.Â  I was wondering which do you like better the new oral b toothbrush or the dazzlepro.Â  I was thinking of purchasing the dazzlepro.? 
<1,1>	Nice stuff...I like most of them you two mentioned.? 
<0,null>	April be careful of receding gums! I was warned of this too from my dentist. Once they recede, they never come back or regenerate. =[? 
<0,null>	You guys- make sure the corn kernels you buy are ORGANIC so that you&#39;ll know they&#39;re non-GMO. GMO foods are really not healthy to eat, and something like 90% of corn now is GMO. Really avoid it at all costs!Â <br />That&#39;s awesome you&#39;re popping your own popcorn. Microwaving isn&#39;t good either, so this popcorn maker is really actually good for you! Popcorn can be a very nice, light snack depending on what you put on it :) mmmmmmmm fresh popcorn <b>drool</b>? 
<0,null>	you guys are adorable? 
<0,null>	Hi April and Justin! You guys always have the best favorites! April that mixer looks amazing! Lots of love! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3? 
<0,null>	I&#39;m also a hard brusher? 
<0,null>	you guys have so many appliances and kitchen gadgets! lolÂ ? 
<0,null>	Best toaster oven recipe ever: English muffin, topped with avocado, a slice of fresh tomato and a tsp of shredded cheese. Sprinkle on sea salt and toasted sesame seeds, then toast til cheese melts. It&#39;s delicious! My Eccos are one of my favorite pairs of shoes I own. And try popping your popcorn in a tsp of bacon grease. OMG Justin will have major foodgasm face. Lol! :-)<br />? 
<0,null>	How exciting!!? 
<0,null>	You guys are made for each other.what a perfect couple.? 
<1,1>	always love watching your random his and her favorites :) something to look forward every month? 
<0,null>	Justin you should definitely check up a book called Pregnancy For Men: The whole nine months. My partner found it very helpful but at the same time it has a lot of humour in it about the hormonal and scary wife&#39;s and how to handle that haha. Check it out!? 
<0,null>	you two are so cute i love watching april and the two of you are so inspiring Â i love your union as a family Â  Â God is in it Â  Â love you two Â  justin you are so supportive and loving april how lucky and blessed Â  my fav for sure Â  congrats on the new addition liamÂ ? 
<0,null>	The tootbrush is amazing April haha? 
<0,null>	That is a sharp car, I am the same way when we get a new car I am into the electronic options. I never knew that your last car was a convertible, it was nice too!? 
<0,null>	I am telling, Justin I have told you about that OptiGrill by Tfal it is the best indoor grill it has setting for every kind of meat and it sensors how thick it is. Also you can manually set it too. Check it out, Pat? 
<0,null>	That is the coolest wine chiller I have ever seen!? 
<0,null>	You should try making the popcorn with coconut oil! You can find it at trader joes or any super market or health food store! It hardly tastes like coconut but it tastes like butter and I just add a bit of salt and it&#39;s amazingggg!!!! Let me know if you try it!!(:? 
<0,null>	I just love u two! Such genuine, happy people!? 
<0,null>	My dad always grinded his coffee beans. I remember staying at my parents when I was pregnant (my husband was out of town for college class) and waking up to the aroma of that coffee grinding :) Loved this video! ? 
<>	A lot of different studies have shown that during pregnancy the body&#39;s release of hormones increases the level of inflammatory mediators that are higher than usual which can lead to tissue aggravation in the gums and could result in pregnancy periodontitis. Also diabetes can have a similar effect on the gums as well :)Â <br />-2nd yr dental studentÂ ? 
<>	Very informative and useful favorites!! Thank you. I really enjoy the way you two work together with giving info and explaining things. April, I love your ability to make us &quot;feel/see/smell&quot; etc whatever it is you&#39;re describing, that&#39;s a gift you gave! And Justin, I truly appreciate your intelligent and well informed descriptions and explanations of things, how they work, what works and doesn&#39;t work about them etc. between the two of you I feel I truly understand the products you&#39;ve introduced us to. LOVE!!? 
<>	He has such a sweet smile? 
<>	You guys are so amazing ! Always positive and grateful :) I love your videos xx? 
<>	Man I used to brush really hard before I had braces, and now I am afraid of brushing too hard b/c I am afraid my rubber bands will snap and the brackets will come off lol, but I am just waiting to get my braces off. I can&#39;t wait to try lipsticks on; you have a beautiful lip color on you btw:) &lt;3? 
<>	OMG APRIL IN ONE OF YOUR RESENT VLOGS YOU GUYS WERE EATING PIZZA BAGEL YOU HAVE TO TRY THEM IN YOU TOASTER OVER YOU WONT REGRET IT LOL<br />? 
<>	IN ONE ? 
<>	I do daily Vlogs and film other videos but I only use my Canon Elph PowerShot. I want to upgrade for better quality video but I don&#39;t have the budget for a camera that is 1,000, like most of the good ones are. Would you recommend this camera for filming videos when just starting out as well? You guys are so great with making good quality vides, editing, and uploading regularly. I&#39;d love some advice...from Justin lol ;-)Â ? 
<>	The lighting is way too bright in these videos? 
<>	Justin I tried sriracha for the first time this week because of you. I was at a restaurant and the bartender was walking by with it, I said I didn&#39;t know you had that here he said we don&#39;t &#39;it&#39;s the bars stash&#39;. He gave me a little to try with my fish and i dont know why but I was not expecting it to be spicy let alone THAT spicy. It was good and I like spicy food but as I get older my body can&#39;t &#39;handle it&#39; anymore if you catch my drift lol. You must have a stomach of steel lol. He did say that it&#39;s no longer available in CA, is this true? And if so do you order it online now? I live in Philly and he said something about them storing it in a warehouse in pa because we have the space. ? 
<>	Hi guys, love it so much when you share your favorites! It&#39;s like reading consumer&#39;s report but I don&#39;t have to read I just watch and listen to you guys. April, love your hair and make up on this clip.Â  Did you do anything different on your hair. IT&#39;s very straight &amp; shiny.? 
<>	Ooo Can you do an updated Macaron video? hehe? 
<>	Great video..thanks for sharing? 
<>	I love watching you ! Its so funny and your realy entertaining ! Can&#39;t wait to see little Liam! Love you !? 
<>	So did the kitchen aid mixer come with the silver bowl automatically and u had to buy the clear bowl seperately? Or did u get to choose which one it come with?? 
<>	haha, you two are awesome, and Justin made me laugh so much modeling his jeans. Great faves? 
<>	You guys are so caring ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½? I love watching you guys (: thank you for sharing your favorites for us and for making videosï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½? I know you guys don&#39;t have to but the fact that you guys care about us, your viewers ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½? thank you, love you guys? 
<>	Hi April. I have a question. Hope this isn&#39;t too personal but I was wondering what size you got in the genie bra? I went on Amazon and the only sizes available are Med, Large, XLarge, XXLarge... I was going to order a medium but I hope it&#39;s not too big. I&#39;m a 34B. And I hate returning stuff by mail. It&#39;s a PIA! Lol. ? 
<>	I love to watch your videos!! ? 
<>	Justin&#39;s modeling is so funny!! Lol? 
<>	Hi April, I brought a Genie bra at Bed Bath and Beyond. Very comfortable.? 
<>	Brushing too hard can be bad on your enamel too! D:? 
<>	You are the best? 
<>	Why are so many of your links to amazon? ? 
<>	LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Genie Bra&#39;s!!!!? 
<>	I love watching your videos guys! You are such an insipiration to be better and be good to loved ones. I really hope one day I find someone to be as happy with as you guys are!? 
<>	Try the Rockport dress shoes as well. My husband has to go dressy for work every day and loves those shoes because they are extremely comfortable! :)? 
<>	The sonicare will actually stop moving if you brush too hard. My brushing habits have improved so much from a toothbrush upgrade.? 
<>	Oooooh Justin. Those are some hoe down modeling skillz!! You crack me up! LOL ? 
You guys are too cute! Love you videos !? 
Hahaha Justin dancing in those jeans was hilarious! Great video you guys. :)? 
You look so beautiful and glowing now.. The pregnancy makes you more glow and radiant April!? 
April you should try the Genie Leggings !! ? 
Excellent picks guys!! The thingy for the wine looks amazingð? 
You guys need to check out Joe&#39;s Jeans, we are having our End of Season sale so all clothing is 30-50% off! If you go to an outlet you can get a pair of $200 jeans for $30-35!!! Tell them Taylor from Livermore sent you :) ? 
April we are toothbrush twinsies I have the same one ;) I love the little red light that comes on! &amp; it makes such a difference in how clean my teeth feel because of the tiny little brush head!? 
April you talked about the genie bra so much that I wanted to try it so I got one for Christmas and I have to say I really love it! I wouldn&#39;t have tried it otherwise so thank you for reviewing it!! you and Justin are my favorite I look for your vlogs first thing when I get on youtube! love you guys, and baby Liam &lt;3? 
Just to let you know there is no links showing up mobile devises. There&#39;s nothing in the down bar :(? 
Great Favorites guys! Thanks for sharing! You two always make my day xoxo? 
You should try the oral-b 5000 toothbrush! I have it and i think it is the upgraded version of yours and i love it so much! You should really try it ? 
you just make my life I look forward to watching you both and your cats. I have cats and me and my hubby are trying to have a baby!!? 
you are the most amazing sweetiest person in the world!! i wish I could meet u someday!! your going to be the best parents eve! I will meet you guys? 
I love you guys , so awesome ? 
Justin, did you dye your hair? It looks soooo much darker. Maybe it&#39;s just me...? 
You guys are so cute! I loved hearing about your favorites, especially the kitchen things. My Kitchen Aid mixer is one of my favorite things!? 
I honestly need to let you know that I love watching your videos! They&#39;re so positive and I truly go away feeling wonderful. Thank you so much :)? 
<br />Ya in east coast we have organic eggs for up to 2.1 ounces, they are pretty heavy ð? 
One recommendation for your toothbrush, my dentist actually recommended the Phillips Sonicare one. He says that toothbrushes that spin aren&#39;t good for your gums either. The Sonicare one is ultrasonic and doesn&#39;t spin. I&#39;ve used both and I prefer the sonic one for my gums cause I have the same problem.? 
My favorites have been my heated blanket. It&#39;s important to have in the winter and living in Minnesota. My husband favorite has been his wart removal. He had a wart on the bottom of his foot and its been helping so very much ? 
Lol! I&#39;m a hard Brusher too! I need that brush. Keep making awesome videos!<br />? 
updated macaroon vid!!!? 
I love this video! I like that y&#39;all included kitchen gadgets ð ? 
You look really pretty April...love watching u guys? 
I died when Justin modeled the jeans with the two kicks ... hahaa...you guys are hilarious? 
7 jeans are the best theyre my faveÂ ? 
I like these kinds of videos they are different. Justin is so funny dancing with his new pant&#39;s.? 
I need a new stand mixer. I really like that soft yellow color.? 
I love that you guys included kitchen gadgets as well as clothing in your haul. Â I would love that wine warmer/cooler. Â I need to find one, and the coffee grinder and the toothbrush LOL, I guess I like everything ;)? 
Hi April and Justin.. i absolutely loved this video but wished u had done it before xmas as the Wine Chiller/warmer would have been an awesome present for my hubby ;) lol but I also like surprising him with little gifts for no reason and this one he would absolutely Love!! So thank you for sharing :) Also, the toaster oven and popcorn maker is awesome!! We stopped using a microwave for over 6 years as they are VERY unhealthy; and we realized that it didn&#39;t seem &#39;right&#39; to reheat/cook with &#39;radiation&#39;.. so now we just use our oven and for popcorn we use a big ol&#39; pot, grapeseed oil and kernels and cook it till it pops! So much healthier and even tastes very yummy!! I only use a very little amount of the grapeseed oil and 1/4 of kernels and it makes the whole pot!! ;) So if ever your maker retires you can always fall back to a good ol pot lol Also I use and old one and not one of my expensive ones because the oil does eventually over time stain the pot... Anyhow.. all your items are awesome!! Thank you for sharing :) Have a wonderful night!! P.S: Thank you for listing the links in the description box, it&#39;s very helpful! As April would say &quot; Thank you Kindly&quot; (would love a tank top that says that *cough cough hint hint) ;) ? 
I have a gift for you and baby Liam but I haven&#39;t been able to send it yet I&#39;m still with family. Hopefully sometime during this week though!!? 
When u guys show the products up close the picture is really clear but when its you two on the couch its really pixely and just the picture isnt the best. Hopefully it isnt just me. But i love u guys? 
April how do you wash you bras so that the pads dont get ruined .. I bought some at walmart.. And they always get ruined..i tried by hand and in the washer and nothing :(? 
Justin, my fiancÃ© use to wear cheaper jeans as well and now he won&#39;t wear anything besides sevens. They fit so well and they last forever! April, I have a problem with brushing my teeth too hard too! I&#39;ll have to look into that toothbrush:). You guys always put a smile on my face. Thanks for the video!? 
April you and I are both aggressive brushers....what a great gift and idea!! ? 
You guys always put a huge smile on my face, April, I make the same noise as u wen I get excited about something hehehe :) x? 
That&#39;s so awesome that your car has a hotspot built in. That&#39;s something that I need. Cause I&#39;m always traveling. And don&#39;t want to use all my data.? 
When u showed the popcorn maker u can see justin go in a circle ? 
I love yoU guys soooo much ;p? 
Y&#39;all make my day and I wish I could met y&#39;all love y&#39;all!!!!!? 
Love this kind of video? 
I had the popcorn maker. You&#39;re supposed to put the butter on the top part with the lid on while the popcorn pops. But after a while the machine broke :( ? 
If u want another way to get your wine cool is to put frozen grapes in it ? 
Â those puffy mints they are my favorite glad to see im not the only one that has them everywhere i put them in my purse lol and school bag :)? 
Love u guys ? 
Thank you guys for your card!!? 
Thank you so much for this video. My boyfriend tends to brush his teeth hard and he&#39;s having the same issue as you April. His gums are receding. Now I have a prospective gift for him! love your videos and you two.?

Your leggings are a bit see through.. We could see your g-string hahah<br />? 
The Ying-Yang sign is not a belife thing, it&#39;s just showing opposites? 
I never try anything on either, girl. I&#39;m a size small in literally everything. So there&#39;s really no point in trying anything on. If it&#39;s too big, too bad, because there aren&#39;t any smaller sizes. And I can just get them tailored to fit me. So.?

My favorite pieces to wear right now are jackets and baggy t-shirts. Jackets because you can just be wearing a plain shirt and throw a jacket on and then you have a nice and complete outfit. I like baggy t-shirts because I am really into the lazy look and I can find really cool ones at the thrift store.? 
Acid wash jeans, and those pants that are loose at the top but right at the bottom (my friends call them poo-catchers ð)? 
lauren you are so close to 1 M !!!? 
Beautiful Lauren, love your style!! can you tell me please where your t-shirt is from? been searching one that color EVERYWHERE? 
Love you Lauren ? 
I knew this was a sponsored video...? 
I&#39;m so late wow !? 
Hello beautiful Lauren Elizabeth of the Internet you are just so so so so SO amazing wow!? 
I really missed these kinds of videos. I love her style and I wish she had more videos about it. IG and Twitter doesn&#39;t do it justice. ? 
Does anyone know where those shoes are from? I loooove them? 
You should do a video about how you workout and eat in a day, because your just like body goals and I don&#39;t even want to wear a crop top because I have a lump on my stomach&#39;!!!!!!? 
where were the sandals from?? 
Recently I&#39;ve been loving simple patterned fabric shorts from Target OMG they are so comfy and cute especially with a simple top and white vans? 
How long did it take u to learn how to spell ur last name is is taking me FOREVER ? 
fitness routine please!!!!!!!? 
Ughhhhhh love. You. We have the same style so thanks for the hauls!? 
I would suggest Kimonos just because since u love wearing t-shirts n jeans u can dress it up with a kimono n u will still b comfortable n at the same time it&#39;s cute. N also just layer necklaces n wear ur jewelry it will definitely look put together. Loved everything u got!!!ððï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?? 
Love your videos ((:?

Omg, I love Madewell too! I bought that same white sweater you bought. It&#39;s so soft and pretty! I&#39;m loving it! I only bought 2 items in there, but I think I want to go online to order a skirt and a scarf. They have limited sizes in the store so I have to order them online. The scarf you showed is already sold out online. Not in that color, only red and green available now. Thanks for sharing!? 
Can i just please have your closet girl?! I really knew that there would be at least 2 sweaters in this haul because of sweaterobsession â¥ Thanks for sharing it with me :&#39;D You looked flawless in this video but I guess itÂ´s like you always look amazing â¥ And I just wanted to mention one thing, I love your voice soo much and you speak so clear that really nearly everyone with a lil bit of english skills can understand you, but idk if it was just me but sometimes the music was a bit too loud so that I focused sometimes more on the music and not on what you were saying, btw the melody is now stuck in my head and l donÂ´t know how to be able to sleep now haha :D Anyways, great video and love you Alex â¥? 
Omg ð± I Love the scarf!! ï¿½??

I LOVE NEW YORK ! :) &lt;3? 
Hi, I have a question about the Steve Madden boots! Okay so you said you&#39;re a size 7 1/2 but you got the boots in a size 8. Did the 7 1/2 fit tight? Did the 8 feel a bit looser? Or did you still have to break it in? I want a pair but I don&#39;t want them to look too big since I&#39;m usually a size 8 and what if the 8 1/2 fits bigger as well. Hopefully you see my comment and answer me! Thank you, love your hauls and look books by the way! :) ? 
&quot;did i just say a stripe of lettuce&quot; hahahahah love you omg? 
The printed pants you bought from Brandy would look nice with the top you&#39;re wearing!? 
You didn&#39;t even show everything on you !?? 
Can I just say that I love EVERYTHING that you bought! Except for maybe the leopard print shoes. I hardly wear any print either. Unless it&#39;s tribal... Then I will! :) lol It&#39;s funny because we like the same EXACT things and everything in this haul I would wear or buy for myself! Love you! :)?

PS- If you want AMAZING bralettes check out my online boutique I have tons of bralettes to choose from and they are all super affordable!? 
Ummmm so I am a new Youtuber and I just discovered you and I think I&#39;m obsessed. Binge watching your videos right now. My videos are SO amateur compared to yours! Lol. LOVED this haul! &lt;3? 
silly question, but what do you use to hang up your polaroids like glue or tape?Â ? 
so model the thongsÂ ? 
you&#39;re the cutest &amp; happiest thing ever ð­ð­ð­? 
LEXI YOUR EYEBROWS LOOK SO GOOD HERE THANKS TO CLAUDIA OF COURSE? 
26 in pants? Oh I am so envious of you x? 
&quot;They look good on the butt, people always comment on my butt&quot; omg...? 
whats the legging brand?? 
can you please do an outfit of the week? I love your style!? 
How old is she ? 
obsessed with your dress, it looks so good on you! where is it from? :))? 
your so cute lmao? 
your figure is absoloutley incredible x? 
What separates you from other youtubers is definitely your personality. I was watching and thinking, wow shed probably be one of my best friends if she lived here! Stay positive :)? 
You are super pretty? 
Loved it!? 
You do not have an ass. Whoever said that lied to you? 
But she has a flat butt...? 
Now look at La-Perla! Â The most expensive women&#39;s underwear in the world! Â By far, there are so many better-looking, and more-fancy women&#39;s-underwear the world-over then La-Perla!!! Â You buy La-Perla, your paying for the brand-name, nothing more!!!!? 
I get you have a nice butt. You don&#39;t need to show me every 5 seconds? 
<a hole in left leg of stockings ? 
Aww you&#39;re so cute ? 
dont you wear a bra?? 
Id like:<br /><br />Xbox One<br />Farcry 4<br />COD: Advanced Warfare<br />GTA V<br />Sims 4<br />Xbox CardsÂ <br />(Kinda a nerd :P)? 
how do you only have 236k subscribers?Â <br /><br />ps your eyebrows look boss in thisÂ ? 
I think it&#39;s so inappropriate showing thongs that you bought? 
Scintillating acquisitions, those thongs Lexie. Forgive my ignorance-maleness entails ignorance on such matters, not infrequently-nevertheless: Unless a gal is scrumptious of derriere at the outset, does such an article really enhance the shape and fullness of her hindquarters in any significant fashion?? 
Your eyebrows look so good in this Video ð? 
To be 18 ..... wait till your 27 thats when everything slows down lol ? 
Omg you channel randomly found me lol I watched some of you videos and I am converted to the Lexi followers ? 
Your super funny and your boyfriend is gorgeous!? 
I am asking for a record player from Urban, some new makeup, andddd a bluetooth speaker for the shower. :)? 
26 is what number for pants (0-6)?? 
You know the commitment she has to youtube when she tries on several pairs of pantyhose. THOSE THINGS ARE THE HARDEST TO PUT ON LOL ? 
I asked for a big makeup bag I could fit ALL my toiletries in. I&#39;m going to Europe soon and I want lot of space for packing my things. ? 
Where do u get the hue leggings? 
u r crazy but I love you so much :)? 
I was on the VS website today and it&#39;s now 5 for $27! Not the same :-(? 
im asking for tie dye sheets but nobody can find them! aahhhhhh? 
You&#39;re gorgeous!! For Xmas I&#39;m asking for clothes, American horror story on DVD (best show ever) and some surprises ? 
You are probably about right. When I was 18 was when I felt the best. I was a senior in high school. (Yes I was behind. Long story short because I was held back but I didn&#39;t fail any grades.) And I met a really special person. And it&#39;s crazy because I first kissed my current boyfriend about 2 months before I turned 19, so basically I was still 18. But actually started dating a week after my 19th birthday. And we are still currently together. Been a year and 5 months now. And I&#39;m 20 now. So yeah. <br /><br />I hope the best for you and Finley. You guys are the cutest!!!!! ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?<br /><br />And on my wish list I only have one thing, to spend Christmas with my babe. That&#39;s all I even want. ï¿½?ððï¿½?? 
I&#39;m asking for an iPhone 4S and a instax fujifilm camera 8 !!!!!!!! ? 
Love how much more daily you upload now that your in laðð? 
your eyebrows look really good here? 
Are the hue leggings see through?? I need leggings that aren&#39;t see through on the booty lol! Any brand recommendations? ? 
Those torn jeans are sooo cute. I&#39;ve been wanting a pair for the longest. I have a bunch of jeans in my haul. Thanks for sharing. ? 
R u single and u r so beautiful ? 
You&#39;re hilarious. I wish we could be friends in real life.? 
Yeah, there&#39;s no way I could wear those bras.Â ? 
You&#39;re so damn cool Lexie!? 
Im obsessed with your jeans, they fit you perfectlyyy! everything you got is on point!? 
Ayyy I just turned 18 ;) It&#39;s a great age but not the responsibility part lol<br />I&#39;m asking for:<br />Bluetooth speaker<br />iMac w/ retina display<br />Clothes<br />Final Cut Pro<br />haha I subscribed to you from that thong video. :P? 
Lexie you have such a nice body omg! And for the holidays I really want a pair of Birkenstocks, I always find myself needing them! Haha but I love this video :)? 
i love yo soooo much lexie! I just found your channel through claudias vlogs and wow, i never knew someone could make talking about thongs funny and light! hahaha? 
Well..I&#39;m in the process of moving so I would appreciate anything for the kitchen or house! Especially items from William Sonoma or The Container Store (Which btw is awesome for not just the kitchen. OCD Organizer) -- this is what happens when you&#39;re older than 18 lulz? 
I love how she shows her underwear and has no shame way to go lmao ððï¿½?? 
Those unif jeans doe ð I want to see them again! 18 is an amazing age, wait till you hit 20, last year was literally the best year of my life. my life is perfect now cause of my bby. ð it felt like I had grown so much when i hit 20 and thought about my 18 &amp; 19 year old self. Enjoy these years gurl, Dats where my point is headed. Ha.<br /><br />As for a wishlist, I don&#39;t have any material things. Just want the power to care for my body and mind. It&#39;s where my head is. â awesome vid. As usual.? 
im asking for a penny board? 
I LOVE THE JEANS? 
You are so happy and positive in this video and you just boost up my mood. Thank you!? 
I&#39;m asking for a silver Michael Kors watch :))?

<b>Claudia DEFINITELY helped out reconstructing your eyebrows. YOU LOOK FUCKING AMAZING LEXIE</b>?

Btw just ask for giftcards from your favorite stores...that&#39;s what I do!!!? 
I feel like I have to dress more mature because I&#39;m 22 and look 16 haha!!!? 
I know this is weird but I really want a kitchenaid mixer.(By the way I am only 12 so that is why it is weird!) lol? 
I don&#39;t know what I want for christmas! I haven&#39;t asked for anything for my birthday which was during the summer but I&#39;m older now so I guess the whole not celebrating thing goes with age.? 
If you look at all the gift stuff on urban outfitters, you&#39;ll get some good ideas :)? 
I normally really like your sense of style, but I&#39;m sorry, those jeans make you look like a mom in the 80s. They fit so strangely and the holes are gross.<br /><br />I know I&#39;m gonna get heat for this but I&#39;m trying to help, I know I would want to hear if something looked bad on me.? 
you are the cutest lil nugget ever ? 
Your brows look amazing!?

Hi, my name is Liz and just like you I have been struggling with acne for a long time. I&#39;m only 16 but I&#39;ve had pretty bad acne for 6 years. Recently I have made the decision to go on a medication called Accutane. Accutane is basically A drug that closes off all of the cells in your body that create oil, which results in the distinction of acne. My sister (same age; we are triplets, I have a brother too) has been Accutane for 5.5 months and her acne is basically gone. I just finished my first week on it and I&#39;m excited about the journey I am about to go on. Although at the beginning when you start taking the drug for a short time, you have a &quot;Initial Breakout&quot; which is when you break out a bit more to get all of the bad stuff out and then it starts going away, is not what I would have wanted I can&#39;t help but look at the end and picture what is must be like to wake up later than usual and not have to worry about covering up my whole face. I recommend going on this drug because the results are completely amazing. Although I am not a dermatologist or a doctor I can say that this drug helped my sister and is helping me (I can already feel that my skin is becoming less oily!). I recommend this drug and talking to your doctor about it if you are suffering from bad acne like I am. ? 
Officially spring since March so yah spring Is already here for a while now lol ? 
I have watched a couple of your recent videos , and I just noticed how pretty your eyes are! <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" ï¿½?? 
Hi! I would love to see an oil control update. Have you found any new products that work well for oil control? Xoxo?

You know that white flowers necles matches you braceletes that you did in an outfit of the day 
Finally a youtube haul video that has my fav store in it &quot;Guess&quot; and not Forever21 haha. 
you shud do a perfume collection :D 
@MakeUpL0VerAndSingeR No sorry =P I&#39;m far far from there! 
you can totally rock that shiny skirt still 
you posted this video on my birthday :) 
@ThenIEatedIt I don&#39;t dress to impress people or to become &#39;more attractive&#39;, that is extremely sad if that is what you do. Never dress for others, always dress of what YOU want to wear not what someone else thinks or wants you to wear. Love your style, embrace your style. Be you! 
@PiinkSparkles You know, we have the same body type (small waist, large breasts, etc.) but I don&#39;t dress like that. I don&#39;t know how much it is that you love your body, or that you want other people to love it. PS: It&#39;s more attractive when you actually leave a little to the imagination. 
U always have such cute stuff from value village thrift store!! The thrift stores around me sell junk!! You are so lucky to get such cute stuff for a really low price!!! I wish I lived in canada, and close to ANY value village, you get amazin things!!!!!!!!!!! Xoxoxo lots&#39;o&#39;love!!!!!!!! 
@imfuckingbored22 Value village thrift store :) 
LOL little HOT hood And Love ur top 
Hooow much did that all cost you ?! 
butterface! 
i love everything! they are really nice! 
do you have a father? 
butter face 
you remind me alot of rachel that was in Big Brother season 12. 
@Polymerclaysavy The only one i know of is skin deep!! :) 
@PiinkSparkles good. about too go out with my friend too savers ! :) and another thrift store near me. 
@Nessule Aw yeah i know exactly what you mean hun! School takes a lot out of us :( haha. No i WIIISH i could shop at dynamite, the closest one is about 6 hours away from me :(:(:(:(:( 
@PiinkSparkles Well that&#39;s cool, I can totally understand wanting to do your own thing. Just didn&#39;t know if you knew it or not. I&#39;ve had some tops with straps and I&#39;ve wondered &quot;Uhm... how do these go..?&quot;. lol 
@KatsWonderland It definitely is supposed to go around your neck, but i like to put my own spin on things :) You have good eyes that you noticed that haha! &lt;3 
I think the rope on the green top is supposed to tie around your neck. Love the white coat (and the Playboy bunny top underneath). 
I want to go shopping with you. How lucky, a dollar for each of those :[ I don&#39;t get to catch up on those sales often -_- D: 
@333buttercup haha you noticed that!! :P ahh i love you LOL 
@VidsByMetz It definitely was hot for spring, and it has carried on to fall as well:):) And i am definitely not American, haha. 
Floral was hot for spring. But whatever, the majority of the american youth are behind anyway xD 
I like how your bracelets are falling all the way up your arm haha OMG GUESS that top is soo cute &lt;3 
nice haul hun!  i wish we had some of these stores in the US! 
I like how you say &#39;leggings.&#39; You say it like &#39;lay gings&#39; :D

Omg ty for linking everything it&#39;s so helpful ? 
Ughhhh!!! I am so incredibly I love with your brick accent walls ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½? I was staring at them this whole time ?

finally, someone with the same sense of humor.Â ? 
I like your hair color here :)? 
I love your you tube channel the most ? 
Yup, red and yellow apparently increases your appetite. That&#39;s why almost all fast food restaurants&#39; logos/branding colors are red and yellow ^_^.Â ? 
I absolutely love that Apothecary candle from UO! I was just wondering how long the Diptyque candles usually last, and how did you clean them out to act as your brush holders? Love your videos, Claire!? 
my cat also gets the after-poop crazies :D? 
i like claire&#39;s videos so much that i don&#39;t even skip the adverts.?

This is bae!? 
<b>double thumbs up</b>? 
does anyone else think that claire is kinda similar to Cristina from Grey&#39;s Anatomy???? 
Love your slaughter t-shirtÂ ? 
I think the thing that sets your videos apart from others is your sense of humor, timing/delivery, and editing.Â <br />And can&#39;t forget Bruce! (sometimes watching your videos is like being at the theater and waiting through the credits for that secret fun part at the end. (Like Bruce again! Too funny!)<br />Second time watching this (once when you posted, and again cause I felt like going through old videos.....ah sleep. such an elusive creature....) and I think THAT is also a thing that sets you apart. Your videos can be watched again and be just as enjoyable the second time around.Â <br />&lt;3 Clair!? 
OMG WAS THAT BRUCE MEOWING AT THE END HOW CUTE I CANNOT HANDLE IT OMMGGGG LOLOL &lt;333? 
you are so fun! !!!love to watch your video!?

&quot;Bruce can you move so i can insert my shot&quot; I died haha love it? 
i believe we are somehow related in a weird cosmic way...i would get the same cardigan or shirt in different colours when i find the one that i really like.? 
I&#39;m obsessed with your style.? 
it&#39;s hilarious how i got the same hm sweaters and i keep saying to myself the same thing : well they are different :DÂ ? 
I watch so many hauls for inspiration but this must be one of my favorites! &lt;3? 
LOVE YOUR STYLE? 
You&#39;re so beautiful! And I love your style, it&#39;s exactly the style I want to be haha :) ?

I like to use the foundation brush to apply face masks whenever I have a brush kit I hate to waste money and not use the brush. ? 
I absolutely love you. You have the same style as me but you have money so I&#39;m stuck with the same crappy clothes lol. Definite role model! And I&#39;m definitely convinced on trying blue/purple undertone lipsticks because of you ?

IÂ´m from Brazil, IÂ love you!? 
Hi, my name is Liz and just like you I have been struggling with acne for a long time. I&#39;m only 16 but I&#39;ve had pretty bad acne for 6 years. Recently I have made the decision to go on a medication called Accutane. Accutane is basically A drug that closes off all of the cells in your body that create oil, which results in the distinction of acne. My sister (same age; we are triplets, I have a brother too) has been Accutane for 5.5 months and her acne is basically gone. I just finished my first week on it and I&#39;m excited about the journey I am about to go on. Although at the beginning when you start taking the drug for a short time, you have a &quot;Initial Breakout&quot; which is when you break out a bit more to get all of the bad stuff out and then it starts going away, is not what I would have wanted I can&#39;t help but look at the end and picture what is must be like to wake up later than usual and not have to worry about covering up my whole face. I recommend going on this drug because the results are completely amazing. Although I am not a dermatologist or a doctor I can say that this drug helped my sister and is helping me (I can already feel that my skin is becoming less oily!). I recommend this drug and talking to your doctor about it if you are suffering from bad acne like I am. ? 
Officially spring since March so yah spring Is already here for a while now lol ? 
I have watched a couple of your recent videos , and I just noticed how pretty your eyes are! <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" ï¿½?? 
Hi! I would love to see an oil control update. Have you found any new products that work well for oil control? Xoxo?

New subbie! Your voice is so cute and comforting xD!Â ? 
Wtf? So having protective stuff is &quot;ILLEGAL?&quot; She literally said &quot;Whats with all this protective stuff? i feel like this is an illegal kit&quot;.Any other woman would have been completely ecstatic to open that, &amp; see it gave her devices to protect herself with! Something that the world is trying to deprive women of! That kit full of PROTECTIVE STUFF could be a gift from &quot;GOD&quot; to you too protect yourself, because you obviously believe you are above being raped, or murdered, but in reality you are a great target, especially men viewing this video, you just put it out there that you &quot;are afraid of stun guns&quot; meaning you don&#39;t have one, and you even think its weird to have pepper spray, so every man viewing this now knows you are completely unprotected, and carry no self defense at all with you.So now the world knows you carry nothing to protect yourself with. You are such an idiot, and are the WORSE role model for ANY BEING on the planet, GIRLS, WOMEN, please do not ever take a word this thing ever says seriously, please keep yourself safe, please carry pepper spray with you, and if you can, get a stun gun, in the end it may save your life someday, though i hope you never have to use it, thats what we all hope, but life is dangerous, and unpredictable, especially because of women like Trisha, that make life so much more difficult, &amp; dangerous for the rest of us.? 
Trish, I think that the only reason the shirt is small is because your boobs are HUGE! Love you and your vids!? 
<a your adorable :)? 
I love your hair so much! <br />?

You&#39;ve got a very nice bronze tan.? 
Trish you crack me up your so goofy ? 
Oh my is she in some kind of medication?? 
Don&#39;t feel ashamed to show us what makes you happy, like cute plushy teddies, incase someone has a smart ass comment like &#39;did you need that?&#39; Fuck them, who are they thinking they&#39;re in a position to judge or even open their mouths? They need to sit the fuck back down, right down. <br />They&#39;re probably socially challenged 12 year olds anyway. Let the adults play nicely and the nasty little children can go to someone else&#39;s channel to vent their, oh so legitimate, &#39;angst&#39;. ? 
You pillows ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?ðð so awesome?

I was wondering if the bangles from peach box tarnish or rust?? 
That red dress is fire on you! Your body is everything I aspire to be. Being stick straight aint cute on me.? 
Girl, your boobs are amazing in that red dress haha, sorry i had to tell you? 
I love your hair color! ? 
LOVE your sense of style!! Great video babes&lt;3? 
Does missguided run true to size? Like according to the size guide on the website? x? 
LOVE!? 
New subbie here! One video and I&#39;m hooked! Lol? 
Hey,have you ever tried an online store called fashion nova? I saw the post and i thought that their clothes are similar to your style ? 
I thought it was Mary Lou minizer? 
Your style OMG CAN I GO SHOPPING WITH YOU?!?ð­ð? 
South Africa ?? 
First time watcher! Subscribed immediately and absolutely love how you include the sizes. Helps tremendously. ? 
I love your hauls! Especially haul with try on. Looking forward to seeing more.? 
Love everything you picked up! We literally have the same style? 
Love it!? 
You should def keep the pink crop top in the size 8!! I actually think it looked so cute on you!!!? 
oooo you&#39;re so puuurttyy? 
I love your makeup in this video :)? 
Loved the haul but where do you live?!? It&#39;s summer and this looked like a fall haul. Girl, you must live somewhere cold.? 
youre my new favourite. where&#39;s your bra from?? 
did you say you were just 5 ft tall? just wondering bc that&#39;s my height lol? 
You&#39;re so so pretty, I love your videos x? 
U know instead of getting rid or exchanging big stuff, u can just shrink them in the wash. Most fabrics, especially cotton, will shrink if u turn the washer on hot with the longest setting and then dry it hot. It might take a few tries but it usually works for me. Polyester doesn&#39;t shrink at all. And rayon is best hand washed.? 
OMG !!!!! Shameless!!!!? 
I love your fashion sense! xx? 
I love your video:) you look amazing! Iam want to order from missguided the bodysuit but not sure what size . I am wearing also 26size jeans from top shop but I was thinking to order size 4 from the bodysuit. Soon can you tell me how tall you are ??? I am 5.4 tall . Did bodysuit is enough strechy????

How come you have a big booty and im here like a post .__.?

If you like highlighters, you should get Josie Maran&#39;s Illuminating Veil. It&#39;s my favorite highlighter right now!!? 
I like your style ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?? 
Worst companies to shop at? 
Everything looks good on you girl because you have such a nice body!? 
I also love the Joni and Leigh jeans from Topshop. I have that bomber as well and I love it! I&#39;m excited to wear it in the fall. Missguided is also one of favs as well. Wish I was able to get that H&amp;M dress, it looks so comfy and easy to wear. ? 
Hey! Loved the vid, where is the top you are wearing in the video from xo? 
Love the red dress! &lt;3And your hair is gorgeous please make a video about how u did your hair that way ? 
I don&#39;t understand why you have to repeat or even mention that you are a size 2. It made me feel less self confident. I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t your intention but this is just some corrective criticism. ? 
missguided has nice clothes but I returned a pair of heels in early May and I still haven&#39;t gotten my refund. and because they don&#39;t have a number to call for CS I email them but you get a different person each time who tells you different things!! ð there goes 50 bucks I&#39;ll never get back!!? 
I really like you but there are too many cuts! ? 
First time watching! I love ï¿½?ï¿½?? 
Great vid. I enjoy getting fashion ideas.?

Don&#39;t let anyone put you down you are just fucking amazing! They clearly are highly insecure of themselves so all they want to do is make people on they&#39;re level.xxxx? 
I am in love with your fashion sense, this is gonna sound so lame but you&#39;ve given me the confidence to wear more revealing outfits and not wear a bra on a night out with certain outfits :) you&#39;re gorgeous and honestly my favourite fashion blogger &lt;3?

That bathing suit looks stunning on you . ð»? 
Favourite piece is the sparkle skirt. Also really loving the swimsuit on you Sam! <br />? 
Hello I had the most of them or like them before seeing your video hahaah know I fell in love with the swimsuit and the maxi black dress, and do you know where can I get good quality bra for strapless shirts or the one showing back? Thanks?

Love all the items you bought but especially the sparkly skirt xx? 
How tall is she ? ? 
That bathing suit is everything!!!!!? 
I just love listening to you talk. You are amazing, love your videos &lt;3 ? 
Your Voice sounds like Leigh-Anne Pinnock&#39;s? 
I am usually annoyed watching youtuber&#39;s haul videos, because instead of them sharing they sound like their bragging. However, with Sammi it is completely different. Her genuine opinion captivates my attention throughout the video. I actually enjoyed seeing every piece.? 
I absolutely loved the shoes and the swimsuit you bought!!? 
Dang girl you look so hot in that swimsuit? 
Your beautiful sammiï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?? 
Please make a lookbook of how you style the silver shoes! :D<br /><br />I ended up buying one cause of this video.. :)? 
ruislip!!! i live there omg? 
You always look lovely but your curly hair looks stunning on you x<br />? 
I admire your talent for styling everything so damn beautifully! Haha - I wish you could be my personal stylist.....maybe you should design an app like Cher&#39;s style-computer from Clueless. Let&#39;s face it, we all wanted one of those. &gt;D :D? 
You are sooooooo pretty Sammi! xx? 
Wow....I didn&#39;t watch her videos since ages and....she has changed a lot!has anybody else got the impression that she&#39;s all about her body and size now?I am. ..also I would have never expected from the old Sammy to put herself in such a bikini in front of a million and over subbies(I guess that&#39;s what huge fake boobs do to you,they turn you into a show off)so happy I don&#39;t follow her anymore....not a good example for humble women around the world....All of those money are doing crazy things to youtubers! :-(? 
Love your sense of style!<br /><br />? 
You&#39;re sooo pretty ï¿½? ? 
Thanks for the vid sammie! I have recently opened a depop shop with some forever 21, H&amp;M and Urban outfitters gently used clothes! check me out @lunashop <a

do you keep all of your clothes or do you give your old clothes/clothes you don&#39;t wear to charity shops? Just wondering because I want to know whether I should hold onto most of my clothes or not because we only wear 30% of our wardrobe? 
These stores are built on the concept of fast fashion. Cheap disposable fashion. Unfortunately the garment workers ultimately pay the price. Many work 12- 14 hours days, seven days a week, and are not paid overtime. A majority of workers are women and many suffer physical, sexual, and verbal abuse. As women we should not support an industry that degrades and hurts other women. Shopping for clothing should not be a hobby but should only be done when necessary. Buy sweatshop free and buy pre-owned. These companies will be forced to change their ways if consumers demand it. ? 
&quot;It smartens up the outfit&quot; lol? 
What colour is your hair dye??? 
Love the prints and great idea to keep motivated! x?

Thank you so much for sharing your style! Its gorgeous!Â ? 
The whole perfectionist bit is definitely an eldest child trait. I am the oldest of 7, and always had to be on point with everything --- in order to lead a great example---at 26 my youngest brother told me to start living for myself and not for others. Which I found ironic, but great advice. Now I embrace imperfections and live my life the way I want.? 
Happy new year Shirly you look fantastic? 
Love the video!!! Please give details on your hair! ?

Michele, this may be a little late but you should check out the ASOS Forever Tee, their plain white one is awesome, it&#39;s very soft and a great fit. I&#39;m sure you would love it too! Xox? 
The willingness to attempt to share things within reason and privacy is awesome of you being that you have went through some serious trials over the last year and we do appreciate that you still make mostly beauty vids and kept the channel alive. It speaks volumes in regards to your character. You look great seem well, still take care of your daughter. As a mom myself who has an older girl it would be nice to get a little update on Addison. Only things like learning milestones and her personality development so far. So if you do decide to make the catch up FAQ vid, just to hear a few things about Addy like he fav food fav color accomplishments funny stories things like that would be nice too. ð Thank you in advance if you decide to. ? 
Your makeup looks amazing in this video!? 
i love your makeup here. and the hair too. I can never get my hair like that? 
I need to check out those slouchy shirts. they&#39;re exactly what I&#39;m looking for!? 
I just love your style !!! I wish I lived near you so I could shop with you ? 
Picked up the pink oversized sweater &amp; Tees! thanks babe! XO? 
Are you getting anything from LC Cinderella collection at Kohl&#39;s?Â ? 
Cute Haul! Love the peony t &amp; the bangles.Â  I don&#39;t have a store close by, so I always shop online with them, they have cute things &amp; very affordable. Thanks for sharing this with us, I enjoy your hauls, they are always Great!? 
I love peonies too...I have a beautiful pink plant in my back yard that blooms every year and its so stunning!? 
You look like spring today!! Love it :)? 
Hi michelle! :-) <br /> I love your style and great haul too I always wait for them haha. Wanted to say you look amazing and I hope you are doing well. Ive been watching you for years now since you left youtube for a little bit and came back and I always thought wow what an amazing person/ role model. I dont mean to bring stuff up but especially with what happened in your blog post and that unfortunate thing you announced I cried with you and I cant imagine the pain. But I also wanted to let you know that I truly admire you and you&#39;ve inspired so many. You did what you wanted to do which is inspire people. I love you very much. Stay gorgeous, beautiful, and happy and most importantly &quot;keep moving forward&quot; ? 
Great video! I totally need to go to H&amp;M now!! I would love if you would check out my most recent video Â : )<br />xo,<br />Darcy? 
I&#39;ll have to check out H &amp; M for myself. Â I have always bought Colette&#39;s onsies from H &amp; M because of the quality. Â They are soft and silky, unlike the Gerber ones from Target. Â If they are touching my baby&#39;s skin all day every day, I think they should be soft.? 
I use to love when you tried the stuff on and posted a pic/video of you wearing it. I know it&#39;s probably time consuming but I loved it :) u picked cute stuff. ? 
H&amp;M is so hit and miss for me... thanks for showing some good finds! I&#39;ll make the trip over to my store :)? 
Hi Michele, I&#39;ve been watching for a very long time and I&#39;m not sure I ever commented on a video before. I read your blog post from last September months ago and for some reason, today I went over and re-read it. I have NO clue what you&#39;re going through, but I just wanted to let you know that your subscribers truly love you. Thank you for sharing your story, and I hope now that more time has passed, you are feeling more and more closure and strength. We all have our baggage, but we will find someone to help us carry that baggage, and I know you&#39;ll find yours to help you carry on!? 
HI Michele, you look extra pretty today!? 
Random but how do you wash ur whites? I feel like mine always end up dingy...? 
You have the BEST HAULS!!!ð? 
We are getting a H&amp;M here in a OKC this summer can&#39;t wait !! Might still order lol? 
Cute peony tee! I told my daughter when they come in season the house will be filled with them for 2 months. Haha. They&#39;re so gorgeous! Happy Spring :)? 
Hi Michele! Love the haul! Would you consider doing more OOTDs? I love your style and it really inspires me! Hope you&#39;re doing well. :)Â ? 
Great haul! I love the basic tees and bangles. ? 
I&#39;m white Tahiti obsessed... I have like 20 and wear them ALL the time! Mom life style :)? 
Has she ever said where she&#39;s from? I&#39;ve always wondered based on what she buys for each season. Love your videos!? 
I&#39;ve been looking for the target tissue T&#39;s to come back as well! I have a couple left in both short and long sleeve, but ready for new ones too! I&#39;m so glad u mentioned them...gonna check out h&amp;m. :) x?

Love this haul Michele! H&amp;M is so hit or miss for me, so it is always great to see what other people have gotten! I am totally going to go to H&amp;M after class today and get that peony sweatshirt! So cute!? 
Oh you got some great stuff! Love the peony tee!! Thanks for sharing beauty :)<br />Steph xo?

Hi Chel! Â I love how you keep calling sweater a jumper; so Brit of you! Â Hugs from Miami! xoxo? 
Love the video Michele! Is the last oversize top an &quot;over the shoulder&quot; top? So excited everytime you post something! You&#39;ve been my favourite for years! Lots of love from Brussels :-)? 
Good morning! This got me in the mood to shop for Spring. It&#39;s hard to think about it with the freezing temperatures in the North East right now. ? 
Yay! Ive been waiting for a spring fashion haul from you :)? 
Does anyone know her height/weight? Just to compare myself for sizing, since I unfortunately have to do most of my shopping online...? 
So happy to wake up to one of your vids!?

Hi guys, I recently launched my YouTube channel and I would really appreciate if you stop by and give me some feedback. Maybe even subscribe, comment or like? I talk about a little bit of everything, from fashion to school, to makeup. If you have the time please stop by it will mean a lot to me. Thank you!! :)? 
what&#39;s the song???? 
The future of getting around in the urban jungle is mixed mode commuting without cars; via walking, cycling and public transport. The fashion brands already can see this trend and adjusting to market demand for commuter friendly clothing.? 
Whats a song??? 
Love the direction. But please remember, helmets n lights are much cooler than concussions and stitches ;-)? 
What is the song they used in this video?!? 
Where is your helmet?? 
Levi&#39;sÂ® Commuter for women commercial shows powerful women in action. <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" 
Helmets anyone??? 
Asses and trap music.. this a bike video? <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" Â  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" Â  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" Â ? 
LeviâsÂ® Commuter collection equips women with technically advanced apparel to ride in safety and comfort, day or night. Focusing on innovations in comfort, coverage, and durability, LeviâsÂ® Commuter meets the needs of your active, cycling-based lifestyle.<br /><br />Shop + learn more: <a 
Now posted on Levi&#39;s and the women&#39;s jeans are $30 more than then men&#39;s? 
great to see no helmets.... Â We need to normalize cycling. Â You don&#39;t need body armour. Â Its not a dangerous activity. Â Otherwise wear them in cars where far more head injuries are caused. Â just ride your bike in normal clothes for everyday commuting and gear up for longer trips. Â ? 
I know most of you on this group aren&#39;t ladies, BUT Levi&#39;s is coming out with Commuter jeans for women. Cool video. Unfortunately I don&#39;t see any on their website.? 
It&#39;s a shame that the only woman that looked like a real cyclist in the video got the least amount of screen time in comparison with the models that were more or less directed to pose in certain ways for the camera. The bridge sidewalk riding and casual lane swerving examples were by far the most damaging to the image of a law abiding bicycle commuter.<br />Hopefully the product is a good one, but judging from the video, the reflective patches need to be a lot bigger if they are to be marketed as safety features.? 
sigh, the link still takes you the men&#39;s jeans. Levis fail.Â ? 
yeah... so where are they?? 
Seriously, no helmets?????? 
Went to the website on the screen but it was all men&#39;s clothing? 
<b>Levi&#39;s Commuter Jeans for Women</b><br /><br />Levi&#39;s finally launched their women&#39;s bike jeans. Having a heck of a time finding more info, though.? 
What song is this in the background......Please?? 
I used to look forward to Christmas and back to school.....I was sure to get a few pair of Levi&#39;s. I remember a jacket that I got as a preteen and got it autographed by the Temptations when they came to Libertyland in Memphis.......way back when.? 
Where can I find a Levi&#39;s Jumper from ?? 
I need to buy a pair or two of Jeans that have this colour, now I know where I can find it :)? 
One thing more, once the Levis&#39;s models were designed to turn bad shaped people into good shaped and it worked perfectly well, now it&#39;s the opposite, even the best shaped look average now. Once a Jeans looked like a elegant piece of clothes now it&#39;s a second hand looking stuff or simply a sort of rag. If you prefer to wear rags and you by a case live &quot;under the bridge&quot; night and day this is clothing for you. If I spot you there in this I won&#39;t be able resist giving you a change believe me.Â ? 
This is disgusting, I&#39;d call it a fashion disaster. I&#39;m seeing women like this on the street everyday and I am not turning my head, just passing by, feel uncomfortable seeing this, makes me anything but excited being near. I feel sorry for a woman who wear this type of clothes and kills her feminitiy in it&#39;s full. Perhaps I am too old fashioned but clothes designed like this is anything but decent on any human being especially female. Do not know why but towdays fashion industry has been trying to turn people into some kind of Â non sexual creatures, women into half men, men into a...non elegant creatures. They all look like a beggars now. It&#39;s not just Levis it&#39;s about all fashion industry around the wrorld.Â ? 
I figured it out :) boiled my jeans for 30 min, threw them right in the dryer and now they fit PERFECT!! Hopefully they don&#39;t stretch back!! I have these in &quot;Old Favorite&quot; and I love them!!? 
I love these so much, I got them true to size and they&#39;re the most comfortable jeans I&#39;ve ever worn!? 
My favorite jeans. The best for me.? 
This is stupid. A girl&#39;s jeans should be tight so we can see their buttox. Stop trying to turn them into ugly guys!? 
I bought a pair in my size, the smallest offered and they were &quot;relaxed&quot; but I want them fitted. Please offer these in sz 23. I really wanted these to work ? 
This is exactly what I&#39;ve been looking for! I would love to have a pair?

Percy Sledge&#39;s Â Â When a Man Loves a Woman ~~Levi&#39;s 1987 Parting~~<br />(Levi&#39;s 1987 &#39;Parting&#39; commercial run in the UK)<br />14th April 2015<br /><br /><a /><br />Percy Sledge, who recorded the classic 1966 soul ballad When a Man Loves a Woman, has died aged 73.<br />Louisiana coroner Dr William Clark confirmed that Sledge died early on Tuesday morning at his home in Baton Rouge. He had been diagnosed with liver cancer in early 2014.<br />Sledgeâs first recording took him from hospital orderly to a long touring career averaging 100 performances a year and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005.<br />Between 1966 and 1968, Sledge used his forlorn, crying vocal style to record a series of southern soul standards.Â <br />While his first hit When a Man Loves a Woman was by far his most famous song, other popular singles included Take Time to Know Her and It Tears Me Up. However, by 1968 he had largely fallen from commercial favour, though songs like Take Time to Know her continue to be revered by soul fans.<br />In later years, Sledge continued to be in demand as a performer in the US and Europe.<br />Sledgeâs version of the song reached No 1 in the US on its original release and reached No 2 in the UK in 1987 when it was used in an advert for Leviâs jeans.? 
RIP Percy Sledge. Great advert also.? 
It&#39;s about time? 
This songs in the trailer for disendents or something ? 
Whats the song?? 
I love levi&#39;s. Just bought like my 80th pair and omg I love them! ðï¿½?ï¿½ ? 
Put some women on there with some ass? 
Glad that Levi&#39;s are getting back to their roots in terms of designing jeans... great looking jeans, and no mistaking them.?

To? 
It&#39;s from 1995, not 2001. It even says that at the beginning.? 
She&#39;s very hot !!!? 
This one was really good? 
Love the way she wiggles her hips while removing the skirt and then putting on the jeans.? 
Wow! Sexist... AND racist... on so many levels! And just what is being advertised here? &#39;Wear LEVI&#39;S, because sexy women on the lam from police prefer them&#39;? I sincerely hope the young man describes the woman, and the clothes she is now wearing, to the authorities, since aiding and abetting a suspected felon is a serious offence... wherever LEVI&#39;S (real ones, at least), are sold. Thanks for posting!? 
Nice. I Would try to keep my cool but idk if i could? 
What, the black guy&#39;s sitting there because he&#39;s a men&#39;s room attendant? Makes no sense as well as being tasteless. Crap.? 
She who&#39;s work wed me? 
I remember this ad playing in cinemas back in 1996. it would only play in R-Rated (North American) or 18 Rated (European) films. so in a packed house it always brought about a chuckle from adult folks. I was in my late teens so would also greatly enjoy this advert. Its only a pity most of these vids on youtube aren&#39;t in HD, but thanks you for uploading a decent clip of it though. this one&#39;s better than most available ones currently on YT. 
there is plenty of websites where real honeys sharing videos that are many times better than these vids, i understand you all too lazy to search so ill tell you where i go check out GIRLCM.COM He possessed the six attributes of the adventurer-- a memory for names and faces, with the aptitude for altering his own; the gift of tongues; inexhaustible invention; secrecy; the talent for falling

Could&#39;ve worn a helmet and promoted a healthy attitude towards safety.? 
Levi&#39;s. No helmet? Â I&#39;m not upset...I&#39;m disappointed.? 
100% agree with Leon Cohen. This is a person who personifies someone who&#39;ll probably ride in opposition to the flow of traffic, run red lights and stop signs, and might even place herself over pedestrian flow. Levi&#39;s, stop trying to be &#39;cool&#39; and instead be real. Promote responsibility over abandoned coolness. Being &#39;carefree&#39; doesn&#39;t absolve people from responsibilities with others. Especially on the street. FAIL.?

Rides a bike with no helmet, no brakes, and no foot retention, levis failed kinda hard with this commercial? 
I remember a whole series of these commercials. Does anyone know where the others might be found?? 
I saw the slight , the demi and the bold curve but what about the supreme curve? =( 
so normal, fat, and obese? 
@Lillr5 bold curve ! 
@omipe3 hardly, just not chunky ankles 
@Lillr5 if you go to levi&#39;s homepage you can take a simple test to see what curve you have. i did it and have bought many jeans, it really works! 
What curve would I be if jeans are too tight on the thigh? 
@WraithGX Cuz u got chicken legs 
None are &#39;perfect&#39; for me. The calf&#39;s and mid thigh areas are baggy on me on each Curve, even with the super skinny ones! 
Best Jeans ever. I&#39;ve never had jeans that fit me this well. 
I got mine today at tue Levi store for 14 bucks!!! (final sale) &amp; I have to say these jeans are sooooooo great!!!!!!! I got them is bold curve! 
im sorry bu you guyst should really find real women with curve to show this your jeans on all this girls look like models that doesnt represent real curves find some real one so people can relate and feel secure before buying them 
American made Levi&#39;s have the best fit. Especially those jeans that were made in the &#39;70s and &#39;80s. 
Until you guys try them on dont judge! Go try them, i love mine! 
The women in this clip don&#39;t have extreme curves like Beyonce for instance. So I think this is crap and no way represents 80% of females! 
BOO LEVIS CURVE I D ! they only go up to a size 33! not much help If you really have some curves, you still have to be a generic size! 
tune the guitar dude? 
fuck that crowd? 
From what I&#39;ve seen of Chris&#39; board, he had a Holy Grail Plus and 2 other pedals I couldn&#39;t identify (that he may have built himself). Pat seems to use slight amp drive and his volume knob to clean up. I wish there were more pics of them floating around!! 
I saw them live shortly before they broke up and the only pedal I remember seeing was the Malekko Chicklet reverb and everyone had one I think. 
pat only uses a reverb pedal, it&#39;s pretty much all down to what they&#39;re actually playing. 
Could you guys probably guess to what pedals there using? 
wow. this song is great, the performance is great, but the audio engineering is terrible. 
this song is fuckn killer. 
and there was &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 WOMEN. 
@bicpenusa lol he looks more like Justin Bieber LMAO 
@PorroFirst not like some guy from those new 50&#39;s bands? 
@PorroFirst he never ever overplays, although he can fucking shreeeeeeeeeeeeed. the drum beat in this song is so awesome, especially the hi hat thing. 
That drummer is like some guy from those old 50&#39;s bands 
it&#39;s actually called &quot;Eyesore&quot; 
What&#39;s the name of this song? 
Great ad!! Love those sexy shots of her on the bed!!? 
these old 501 ads - fantastic music too 
i love Levi&#39;s (thai land) 
Great! Thanks! 
Like Alice keys 
Whats the song called.? 
Where can i find the song that she&#39;s singing the lyrics to in the commercial??? 
I need to know the song? 
Almost made me cry. 
Huge thanks again for inviting me to share my story! Katie Spotz 
This is a feel good story! 
Thank you for letting me be a part of this. Priya Lakhani 
@HailoMan Always watch the credits. You&#39;ll find the music info by 6:44. 
Why do I have to watch these flat-assed women in jeans?? 
Fuck you and your fucking pants you fucking cunt,a fucking <a advertisement and you wouldnt let me skip it,really. Oh yeah and your jeans look and feel like the back end of a cactus,â¬50 for a peice of shit pair of pants,thats bullshit.? 
love this video bc I knew 5/6 women in the panel but i am always so surprised and impressed by missy the only one i had no clue about and the things she says and the way she says them &lt;3 like what a badass woman.? 
Lol I love how Yvonne is the only one sitting like a man in this panel? 
Jennifer Morrison was killin&#39; it! She&#39;s just so well-spoken and sweet, my eyes and ears were all over her during the painel! Keep up the good work Jen!? 
I like how Zach and Missy are all love on this panel, but like 6 months from this, they&#39;ve gotten a divorce.? 
Jennifer always knows what to say, she&#39;s so well spoken it blows my mind! ? 
The guy from Sweden was wearing a very nice Thor&#39;s Hammer.? 
Ugh, I wish I could have gone to this? 
The next panel needs to have Crystal Reed? 
If there&#39;s a repeat of this panel this year, I think it&#39;s safe to say Missy won&#39;t be attending.? 
What does Missy say <a F*cking __?<i>_</i>? 
Yvonne hasn&#39;t got ANY makeup on &amp; her hairs not done yet she&#39;s STILL just so naturally beautiful &amp; has a stunning figure.<br /><br />I know in the past a lot of fans hoped Yvonne &amp; Zach would get together but I think the fact he&#39;s very religious &amp; she&#39;s not meant they just didn&#39;t suit each other. It seems Missy is right for him as she&#39;s very religious like him.? 
You aren&#39;t Australian blondie? 
Shut up you Fat ugly bitch? 
Ming na is so much hotter in person\? 
Missy is so perfect in every way? 
absolute shit panel? 
Missy peregrym Is Such a Great Acteress! &amp; MELISSA PEREGRYM (Missy) IS EXTREMELY VERY BEAUTIFUL! I JUST LOVE MELISSA Peregrym! &amp; MELISSA PEREGRYM IS MY LONG TIME VERY BEST GOOD FRIEND ALWAYS! She has been my Best Friend for 16yrs! And She Will ALWAYS Be THAT TO ME! ALWAYS &amp; FOREVER! FROM GARY LOUIS TRIESELMANN MELISSA PEREGRYM S BEST Longtime FRIEND ALWAYS! ? 
thye&#39;re all fricking incredible but when missy walked on that stage my heart fucking skipped a beat she is just everything :&#39;)? 
When Missy said &quot;fuckin&#39; MAN&quot; I wonder what Zachary did to make her crack up like that?? 
I&#39;m on no-fap and this is hard to watch.Â <br /><br />I want to watch everything but I almost lost before the 5 min count upon Sophie Turner entrance :&#39;(Â ? 
Marvel&#39;s Agemt Carter is on now which stars a female lead role.? 
They should do the same panel again but instead with men? 
This panel was awesome to re-watch. Well played NerdHQ on getting such a varied line-up. O and Jennifer Morrison... that dress though.? 
Gee Ming na is MULAN! Could you get anymore badass than Mulan?! No! ? 
That girl at <a I felt so ashamed for her I could barely watch it. Gosh...? 
I love how zach and missy are sitting the exact same way? 
they need somebody from the walking dead for sure? 
Our first guest.... Yvonne. Which means the rest can stay home. Weeeell Missy is also pretty cool... and Jennifer... and Ming-Na. ;)<br />CRAZY how well Ming-na looks, what is she now 51?<br />Retta let the others talk, every answer you give is a 5 minute monologue...? 
I really enjoyed watching this panel, but i feel like many of these ladies veered off topic and just spewed answers off the tops of their heads. They all seem lovely just a tad over excited to hear themselves talk.? 
Missy Peregrym = flawless. Love her DGAF attitude.Â ? 
Yvonne and Sophie are by far the classiest and most cultured woman there.<br /><br />The others are typical american crass uncultured &quot;trailer trash&quot; as americans say.? 
Jennifer Morrison and Missy PeregrymÂ  by far my favourite.? 
THE BEST PANEL EVER! Good job Zack :) <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" Â  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" Â <br />It would be so awesome if it&#39;s make every year!!!! <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" Â <br />And more fantastic if you guys can bring Meryl Streep, Sigourney Weaver, Emma Stone, Emma Thompson, Melissa McCarthy, Emma Watson, Lena Headey, Angelina Jolie, Judi Dench,Tina Fey, Ellen Page, Lupita Nyong&#39;o, Stana Katic, Lucy Liu and so much more! :D? 
this is probably the most important panel ever, and i believe it needs to be done every year.Â ? 
Missy is one of my favorite people ever! ? 
I don&#39;t like how while they are empowering women they seem very degrading to the men there. That&#39;s not what kind of equality I&#39;m for, mostly because it&#39;s not equality at all.? 
Wooooh New Zealand!! It&#39;s definitely a good place for a holiday :)? 
Is there a men-only panel available where the audience members get to talk about having a penis?? 
&quot;So ladies, my question is to all of you, how does it feel being outside the kitchen?&quot; I would pay to see someone say that.? 
Can I just say as a guy that these women have bigger balls then ME LOL I think they are all fabulous and 9Kita1 I think it is a annual event but if it isn&#39;t it should be My niece Michelle grew up in a time where woman were not given strong roles in film and It saddens me she lived in a time where strong women were held back , My Mother was a very strong person and even with me having a disability Physical and Learning disability she still let me do what I needed to do Im a Medical Assistant and proud of it LOL but I would love to meet every single woman on this panel? 
This panel was awesome. Can&#39;t wait for next year!? 
lol i love that line<br />&quot;Discriminate against me, just pay me a check&quot;? 
man yvonne is just perfect. she&#39;s everything. missy is just a little bit over the top for me idk if she just tones down a snitch, she&#39;d be perfect too. everyone else is simply amazing. definitely one of the best panels if not THE best.? 
I have always been a big fan of Zach since Chuck.. Awesome panel man!!? 
Chirstians and cursing...don&#39;t go together? 
HOLY FUCK THAT&#39;S MULAN? 
I honestly didn&#39;t know Zach was married to Missy Peregrym that lucky bastard, but I do love when 2 awesome people I like and respect on their own get together.? 
I can see why Missy and Zach are married :DÂ ? 
The chemistry between Zachary Levi, Yvonne, and Zach&#39;s wife could have been delved into a little more.? 
This panel was awesome and Zach is such a trooper for setting it up and enduring it. The reference to a curse jar made me chuckle, my co-workers put one a couple years ago mainly for me and maybe a couple others but ended up disbanding it after a year. It never modified anyone&#39;s behavior personally i would continue to drop curse words but always pay up while others continued to curse and not pay. At the end of the year though we made a sizable donation to charity with all the money wish I could say it had been Operation Smile.? 
if he hosts a rookie blue panel next year i might cry? 
Yvonne Strahovski is scary hot? 
I know it&#39;s not a big deal to many, but I really wish they didn&#39;t curse so much. I had to stop watching it because I was offended. I think I&#39;d enjoy most of what they had to say if only there were a &quot;PG&quot; language limit.Â ? 
This was really cool.? 
So basically, by not announcing the individual actresses, they gave the fans only one common characteristic - females in strong roles - which was why their questions were mainly about sexism. Am I right?<br />I wonder if they&#39;ll do the same thing next year or if they&#39;re thinking &quot;this was way too heavy&quot; and they&#39;ll &quot;learn from their mistake&quot; and announce some names. Honestly, the fans in the room and here on YT seem to be happy to have heard them really discuss the topic instead of dancing around it.<br />Personally, I&#39;d like to see a similar panel with feminist screenwriters (male or female) - or with actresses who are opinionated about their roles and ready to discuss the industry (like Missy was).? 
I came for Jennifer Morrison stayed 4 everyone ? 
Great Panel and Great Audience! Love it! It is refreshing to hear so many good questions instead of all the typical &quot;shipping etc.&quot;, not that I don&#39;t enjoy at times. Also, love that the questions were for all not just 1 or 2 of the panel members.? 
Brilliant panel. I enjoyed every minute of it, and I hope to see something similar going forward.? 
This was so fun and entertaining to watch.? 
While they are all actors (actresses), it&#39;s a nice panel.? 
Great directors and producers, like Gale Ane Hurd, work so much with the work on Terminator, Aliens, Robocop and now she is in the great show of the walking dead. People gave so much credit to James Cameron, but the one that put so much effort and make the damage control of cameron carachter, was Gale Ane Hurd. Kathryn Bygelow make so good work with the hurt locker, Zero Dark Thirty and the amazing Point Break.? 
Awesomeness. These women are great.? 
They should add some fucking cameras into panel.i mean they are laughing and we dont know what they are laughing at.? 
Where was the fun and humor that one see in the male or co-ed panels? This panel is what I imagine a women studies class would be like i.e lame.? 
Best panel of the year. There were some really great ones, but this one beat them all.<br />+1 forÂ annual panel.<br />Ming-Na Wen has a huge badass vibe for me for some reason, no matter what role she plays orÂ whether she&#39;s just herself. I can&#39;t get enough of her.Â I never could get into &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, but Retta is great. Maybe I should give it another try.? 
love this panel...Â ? 
Nerd HQ, thank you thank you thank you for this panel.Â  I haven&#39;t seen all of these ladies in their respective films or TV shows, but they were absolutely brilliant here.Â  Thank you for giving them this avenue to share their thoughts with us.? 
Feels like every female panel I&#39;ve ever heard.Â  Nothing unique here.? 
Holy Hell- this is why I can&#39;t stand these types of Geeks/Nerds.Â  Even before it came up I knew I was going to see shite&#39; costumes (as most Westerners suck at it) &amp; someone crying.Â  Not to mention the most basic name dropping... You are at Batman Wonder woman level. I&#39;ll stick with the 148.? 
I actually love Missy&#39;s attitude , Zach is one lucky guy.? 
I love Missy Peregrym, ok? Bye? 
After this I feel like my 20$ contribution were money well spent. Very personal and emotional. I respect Yvonne very much but I have to disagre with her about her in a bikini was sometimes unessesary? I mean come on! ;) Also very nice to get to know Zac&#39;swife a bit. I am looking forward to seeing Zac and Missy in Sweden soon;)? 
Missy peregrym is my absolute inspiration &lt;3 ? 
AGAIN! What a great panel. Love these badassessss? 
lolol@<a I believe Retta was talking about Road Trip, particularly the scene with the big black girl and DJ Qualls.? 
I really wish they would have touched more on having questions aimed at them because they are women. Everyone is up on the movement of strong female characters so everyone wants to question it like it&#39;s some sort of new species. I would have asked how they felt getting questions segregated to them due to their gender and not totally due to who they are as a human being. Jennifer Morrison really only slightly touched on the subject, and I really hope the industry starts to move away from &quot;oh you play a BA woman, how does that feel?&quot; type of questions to &quot;Your character is really amazing, how do you feel to be playing such an inspiring role?&quot;? 
here for retta and wen... wen is 50 and she looks incredible!? 
Jennifer Morrison looks like a goddess in red! Already noticed that on the show last season. It&#39;s really the best color for her.Â ? 
Yvonne... wow. just wow. Damn, that girl is fine.? 
lmao they had no chill on this panel haha? 
All the women up there were GREAT, but is it me or does Yvonne just seem so much more classy than the rest of them?? 
I adore Yvonne!!? 
First question person at <a I assume she&#39;s cosplaying something?? 
DIVERSITY loving it? 
hooking the jeans was actually pretty funny when I was doing it, but still thats what they wanted and I was happy to deliver. Brandon did a great job for all the still shots on horseback and the close ups of the face on the dummy horse, but the rest was all me. It was a total hoot..? 
I want to sleep with her? 
lucky horse? 
Brandon Merrill is the rider. This commercial was actually banned from TV in some places. BRANDON MERRILL was born in Colorado and raised on a ranch in Wyoming. She first gained national exposure when she was featured in an article about the Cheyenne Rodeo for &quot;W&quot; Magazine. She was subsequently signed by DNA Models and appeared in print ad campaigns for Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, and the Limited, and in such publications as &quot;Vogue&quot; and the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch catalog. A renowned rodeo champion, Merrill makes her feature film acting debut in &quot;Shanghai Noon.&quot; I was lucky enough to meet her once. Her mother-in-law was a customer of mine. She is a very beautiful and talented lady.? 
The stunt rider is who is the real star of this ......? 
which pair is that anyway? 
Giger sold out 
I only came here for the Giger Train and Saddle. 
Not a western saddle mate. A Nightterror saddle. 
Who is the bitch? 
for one, that American saddle bred would not have lasted that long in the air with that heavy western saddle. second, jumpers do not use what that bitch was using. 
me too! lol 
don&#39;t try this at home... 
SUPER !!! Thanks. 
Is it just me or has a jeans commercial never been so fucking epic. 
lol, I want a pair of those clips for eventing! 
Very cool commercial but I couldn&#39;t help but think ouch when she jerked on his mouth at the begining. 
@numinaII Guess what&#39;s carrying? I&#39;ll give you a hint, its eggs. 
I wish that they still designed those kind of levi&#39;s for women, big back patch and everything, Now its so fricking small. My fanatasies cry out in anger. 
that horse has a nice ass 
I wanna buy a horse and try that out... 
she looks exactly like Karina Lombard 
mmm... i need a horse 
I need those! 
that looks like soooo much fun! 
@Weaponsmaster8595 haha I don&#39;t I&#39;d be able to stay on if I tried! ;) And my knees are god awful already so I don&#39;t think that would turn out well :) 
lol I love exaggerated commercials. Very amusing, one can only dream about doing something like that :D 
@amystrahan Take soooo much practice. I&#39;ve been sort of trying just for fun for about a year and I suck badly lol 
@squirttle92 hahh yess they do use their knees:) hahaa. i dont think I could do that! :) 
@amystrahan xcept jockeys XD knees in!!! grr lolz 
actually... its calf and inner thigh. you arent supposed to ride with your knees. I do it soooo often thoughh! :) 
Looks like thier promoting the horse to me 
cool! what&#39;s the song? 
good lookin girl :} 
@HunterToJumper you can&#39;t have knee strength a knee is a joint not a muscle lol 
hahaha, seriously? ok commercial, but even if it was possible, that is a pathetic way of staying in the saddle. It&#39;s called knee strength, all jumpers should have it =P 
lol 
I&#39;d invest in that. xD 
lol that was interesting... that a good way of keeping your seat in the saddle... to hook your jeans?... lol 
although over the top, yet pretty good 
i have the light blue wash levi&#39;s and they look sweet on me lol! people can&#39;t tell the difference that it&#39;s women&#39;s jeans lol.? 
Levi&#39;s Women&#39;s Quilted Leather Bomber Jacket? 
Who is Alicia Keys?? 
Absolutely ^^ 
I love way I look and very happy and my skin? 
Still a glorious video? 
i remember this commercial but with diferent soundrack the one i remember had vocals i think? 
UNITY IS INFINITY? 
<a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" engineered jeans? 
&quot;&quot;However good the effects are, they will look like a crutch if the storytelling isn&#39;t there - and what we have here is a 60 second love story&quot; Glazer, 2002? 
<a Ad - Jonathan Glazer (Original Soundtrack)</a>? 
This was a great one? 
Now, when I saw it, I realized how fuckin perfect fit Sarabande is.? 
Isn&#39;t that Theo from Braquo!? 
still as intense as I saw it years ago! 
Nice ad. Unfortunately these jeans fit me like normal condoms fit Chuck Norris. 
2 heroes testing out there Newly found powers! I&#39;ve been lookin&#39; for this commercial since i was a kid. I started to think it was a dream i had. 
brilliant ad... so much crab... 
love this commercial 
The one with &quot;Sarabande&quot; in the background I guess. 
@akses67 No, it&#39;s Vivaldi&#39;s Sonata &quot;La follia&quot;. One of the reasons why I&#39;m proud of being Italian. 
@alfonso2663858 which one do you think of as &quot;other&#39;? 
the agency &amp; client made the right decision, this version isn&#39;t as good. lacks the romance, otherwise my favourite spot ever:-) 
Get the Jonathan Glazer DVD - lots of great stuff on it. 
it is ok, but i like wrangler commercial better. the editing - this is what blows my mind away there )) thanks for this one! btw have you ever seen mtv anti-heroin ad with a asian girl injecting the snake in her arm (very stylish b/w, i ve seen it in 90s). link me if you find it )) 
I tried to do that... I was spashed to the wall 
finally i found this ad! I saw it 10 years ago at tv! Awesome work! 
The original version, fuckin nice! 
Levi&#39;s Women&#39;s Asymmetrical Leather Fringe Jacket? 
<span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" oid="103077697604541281766">Alicia Keys</a></span>Â you are amazingly right. I don&#39;t know <i>HOW</i> many times I was told, &quot;you can&#39;t&quot; when in my mind I kept on saying, &quot;I can, I can!&quot;? 
Double Standard as fuck. If I said all naturally badass!! All men are unique, powerful and incredible. All the feminist and arngy wemon would think I`m sexist. These are sad times.? 
Alicia Keys is the PERFECT rep for jeans, she got the cakes and beauty.? 
My Lil cuz in the video. Good job nena! She is the girl with curly hair with red in it. Whoop whoop? 
not all women. Are there badass women? yes. Are all men badass? No. are there badass men? yes. I find it very disenginuous to say &quot;All <i>___</i> are <i>________</i>&quot;, it completely throws individuality out the window and is a stereotype.? 
AWESOME LOVE IT? 
<a Very Good Dog? 
Yah, I Saw it on TV 
Your Right That is Her 
that doesnt even remotely make sense 
This is Oona Hart. She was on the TV show &quot;Slider -The Other Slide of Darkness&quot; S03E21and &quot;Vanilla Skys&quot; 
that&#39;s a good dog. 
those jeans look so good on her :D 
what a stupid commercial 
The greatest Levi&#39;s Commercial I have ever seen. And the funniest, too. 
Good old regular 505 jeans. My favorite jeans of all time. Not too baggy or skinny. 
@sharkways yea, you&#39;re wrong. dumbass nigger 
@mekosilvar= If this is gay, I am the Holy Roman Emperor. 
It could&#39;ve also passed as a women&#39;s underwear ad! 
She has great looking legs 
yes it did 
good dog 0:31 
Love that sexy blush she gives @ 0:55 
good dog:) 
Did this ever air on tv?

hi!! first of all, iâve to say that iâve watched your channel and i love it. i was thinking too and I thought that you could do other kind of videos, some differents, for do something funny and special in your channel. particulary I was thinking that you could do it challenge videos. cause Iâve seen many youtubers that do these videos and it seems so awesome. and cause I thought you wont know how to start, and what challenge will be the first, Iâve been watching videos and thinking about it and I found some one interesting. maybe itâs a little crazy and stupid, but itâs a good one for start. the challenge basically is to take a shower fully clothed . but for do it funnier and maybe difficult it will have to be in party clothes. something for example like a dress, tights and heels, or maybe a skirt with a top and a pair of boots. as you want, but something fancy. and other thing you can do it too if you are able is to do it in cold water. It will be fun see your reaction when the cold water starts falling over you. and maybe you can do it other funny things as sing a song, cause everybody say that people sing their best songs under the shower, lol. Well thatâs all. sry for write so long. tell me with your opinion pls. I hope you like it and decided to do it. Im waiting any answer. cheers!!!? 
Did you lighten your skin or maybe darken your hair color? Your complexion is pretty light now. I do think this looks suit you and overall compliments your hair color. Oh, and you&#39;re pretty as always. ?

Just curious and please do not take offence. Happy to ask and learn more a bout you as you are a lovely girl always generous showing and sharing your shopping experience and good products as well. Thanks.?

I live for these hauls xoxox? 
I love this collective haul!? 
- a video styling those trainers would be fabulous! ive never been a fan of them only because they are synonyms with the bad kids from primary school lol! but i&#39;d love to see what items you pair them with!? 
Hi Shirley,Â <br /><br />I got a question about the mom jeans from topshop. I wanted to order them a few weeks ago but didnt because i wasnt sure about the sizing(i dont have a topshop where i live or anywhere near).<br />I do own a few pair of jamie and joni jeans.. Is the sizing comparable?<br /><br />xx? 
Shirley pls can you do a video with some of your pants. I really love the pants you wear like the one this video. Please? 
touch Shirley. touch. haul is great. got the nude soft pinky gladiator when they first had it in a while. I set my eyes on them after days of looking for gladiators and my eyes went really wide open up to my ears. I put it so quickly in my basket and paid like someone was chasing me lol. got it, wore it once and its been sitting in a corner since then probably not to be worn till next year lol.Â <br />Now I just want another pair. i love shopping hehe. anyways, you look gorg as usual? 
Where&#39;s the jumper that you&#39;re wearing from? ? 
Lindex is a swedish clothing brand :) If you look around you can find some really nice pieces there! :D x? 
your so beautfulllll<br />can someone tell me what her ethnicity is?? 
what specific shade of the double wear foundation did you get?? 
love your vids.Â  yess to the shell toe addidas.Â  slight pet peeve--referring to beige,peach tones as nudes. that shouldn&#39;t be the default nude. for a brown girl and i share your complexion, that color isn&#39;t &quot;nude&quot;.Â Â  See NubianSkin, UK based lingerie company. They offer a wide variety of actual nude tones for brown skin. Would love to know what you think of them? 
Can I just say how much I admire u. Im literally a big fan of your gorgeous smile and style. I love how you are very style inspiring and that you share your wardrobe ideas with us. Please more more more lol? 
what song was playing at the start of the video ???? 
Gorgeous pieces and hilarious bloopers, looking beautiful as always TFS!? 
Am in love with everything..? 
LMAO shirley i love you!? 
Do you think you will have a periscope account soon? I would love to see your shopping trips? 
I giggled when you pulled the white sneakers out. Â My girls have worn that style with their school uniform for the last few years. Â Be careful with the white ones because when the front of the shoe gets dirty it may become discolored. Â Make sure you keep them very clean or they will be off-white in no time. Â But something tells me you won&#39;t be running around outside and getting them too messed up. Â Haha! Â <br /><br />That Zara bag, though! Â I really like that. Â I have to check and see if they carry it in the US as well. Â I am a bag lady who needs to scale down.? 
Loving your video ï¿½?ð I have big head too and I do braids soooo.. It&#39;s my struggle to find a unique size hat ... Urban outfitter i Love you ï¿½?ï¿½? you too +ShirleyBEniang ? 
Shirley what size did you get in the sweater that you&#39;re wearing ?? 
Go Shirley! Keep the videos coming.? 
I work at Lindex in Iceland, you can have some good finds in there and the price is great. The store in the uk just opened a few months ago. Love the shirt you bought :)? 
I love everything you bought!!!!!!? 
Stradivarius is my favourite shop I can&#39;t believe u didn&#39;t have it in UK ! It&#39;s here in the Dubai in almost every mall? 
Love your videos, and you&#39;re style it&#39;s so bomb! Simple and chic ? 
I really loved this haul! Also the ending LOL the tag snapping your face then the video cuts offððð? 
Mister Clean Magic Eraser will clean those white shoes.? 
So I recently went to Zara (first time) and you were definitely my inspiration! Lol, like everything I bought I modeled after a few of your different look books. You&#39;re amazing ð©ð©â¥ï¿½?? 
i love Stradivarius! I shopped there when I lived in Spain a couple years back. The prices are good. Even better during a sale (they have a big sales during the same time Zara does)? 
really liked this video :)? 
Seriously you are my goals in life personified! Slay Shirley, sa-lay!!!? 
shirley, can you do a video where you style all these items?? 
YayYY I guess white and right! Can you do a lookbook real soon I really love your lookbook for back to school specialy I am going Back to school on September 1? 
Hey Shirley I really wan to see your natural hair you are so beautiful? 
I always wonder where you shoppers put your goods. its impressive! I literally have no more space for any more shoes/bags or clothes in my house and i have stopped shopping cos i have nothing i want to get rid of.<br />Well nice bits you got there x? 
You have awesome taste in clothes Shirley, would love to go through your closet. Do you ever sell off your designer duds? Thanx:)? 
Loved the vid &amp; your silliness ð?

Hey guys im new to Youtube and i make beauty,hair and fashion videos ð Im trying to build my channel so please subscribe and i will subscribe back ð Thanks my loves ððð? 
Anyone knows the Song that was playing at the end? Shirley was singing and dancing to it. That soft jazzy Afro beat Sounds like something I&#39;d like. ? 
Haha you make me laugh the way u justify your buys, who are trying to convince? Defo not us hihihi it&#39;s ok Shirley to be a shopaholic? 
Hi Shirley! I&#39;m curious about your filming .. did you buy a ring light? your videos have gotten so vibrant ? 
shirley! love your style? 
I was watching this video laughing at the fact that its definitely supposed to be summer in the UK and you&#39;re wearing a jumper.? 
I recently was that pink dress on the ASOS website &amp; I just fell in love with it. Can&#39;t wait to see your &#39;Get Ready&#39; video of it. X? 
Everything was so pretty and cute? 
Shirley- jeans are LEG PRISONS ðð«? 
Will you do a video of the products you&#39;ve used up? I saw beautycrush do one of those vids and thought it would be awesome if you shared the things that you&#39;ve loved to death too :-)? 
That sweater looks SOOO cozy!? 
I love your style!? 
Omg i just love your videos and your fashion! Favourite youtuber hands down ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?? 
I want your sweater. Its not available in the US though.? 
You did a Refreshing skin routine for summer. Can u do a summer one too? Keep your skin looking great in the summer months. And what do u do for workouts in the summer?? 
Use a spray called never wet to keep your white shoes spotless ? 
Hi Shirley, Love your this haul. Enjoyed your previous video as well, I missed London. I know you are into figures/maths, do you have or keep a budget in mind before going shopping? Just curious!? 
yess, please do a lookbook with the superstars! thinking of getting them and could use some inspiration :)? 
Can you do a perfume collection ?? 
Shirley, those black Adidas sneakers you bought are considered school shoes here in the Caribbean ð ? 
Thanks for sharing I&#39;m gonna check StradivariusÂ out seems good, loving t wizkid at the end :)? 
I love it! I love it! I love it! and I love you! ? 
Your eyebrows ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?? 
Love it but could you try on the clothes when you do a haul like this thanksð? 
Loved the haul and how consistent youre being with your uploads! <br />Lindex is a Swedish company (I think, since it&#39;s everywhere here in Sweden) just like H&amp;M, that might be why they seem so similar :)? 
I was stalking the new autumn winter stock on Zara&#39;s website and saw that crop with the matching culottes - they would look amazing on u if you haven&#39;t seen them already! But I&#39;m pretty sure this is fate telling me I need the set haha? 
stradivaruis one of my favourite store the have amazing stuff just perfect ...? 
You werent kidding when you said &#39;massive&#39; hahaha. <br />Shirley, what lens set up did you use to film this? The quality of this video is divine. All that blurring of the background and yet you still look so good and crisp! ? 
Love your style. Gladiators are my fav! ? 
Lmfao i love how you were trying to justify every perchuse , loved all the items though . Please do a lookbook ! ? 
I LUV YOUR STYLE SHIRLEY &amp; YOUR LOOK BOOKS!!? 
There&#39;s a dupe top at Primark for that first Navy top from Topshop btw ðð?

Hi <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" oid="117070715205084440493">Shirley B. Eniang</a></span>Â  ... I absolutely adore your channel! Keep rocking on! Can you do a video on bold lip colors on full lips?? 
Try boohoo or public desire or aldo for the flats.? 
Love that dress.. it&#39;s amazing! Can&#39;t wait to see it on you.. It&#39;ll be gorgeous :) xx? 
Your hauls ððð . <br />They give me fashion inspiration âºï¿½? keep up the good work ? 
I think you&#39;re the first Youtuber ever to put &quot;MASSIVE HAUL&quot; in the title of your video and to actually do a MASSIVE HAUL !? 
Love it! You have such poise, I love your taste too! <br />I was thinking, maybe you try the Lindex Chiffron Shirt with a Turtle Neck Midi Dress! <br />Slip on some heeled boots and see how that turns out! :&#39;)? 
J&#39;adoor ton haut!? 
Love you&#39;re style! Can you make more fashion video! ð? 
Super vidÃ©o NoÃ©mie <br />Bye Bitch kisses ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?? 
I love both those stores!? 
bravooo tfate9 enty w el video :*? 
like the Bridget by Armour on you... I love the nudes for myself,and like the peach/pink tones in the nudes lately..maybe it is my summertime tanned skin that might make me lean towards those tones right now.? 
Lisa, I&#39;m not sure if this has ever been offered to you, but when i was in sunglasses hut the last time they offered to bend the frames to custom fit my face. I was afraid to do that but I believe they use heat and it does not damage the glasses. Plastic or metal. Hope this might help! ? 
I had that Rock Violet shadow too!.. Loved it...beautiful color. Â ? 
Lisa ..great video as always...? 
I liked that you tried on the lip products, so I can see what they really look like, but now I want the Nudist color!? 
That bite lip color looks pretty on you. ? 
what do you film with? ? 
New subscriber. I love you already!! Good vid and ur personality is so awesome. ðð Ty!!? 
Your makeup looks good! Love watching your videos. ? 
I just adore your outfit! Â The Rag and Bone booties look so great with the jeans. Â Congrats on the weight loss,,,you look great!? 
I went to Gap this past weekend and they didn&#39;t have any of the cute stuff that you&#39;re always showing :-(? 
I cannot find those gap tees you wear, I&#39;ve searched high and low. If you know the name or can find the link please let me know. Thanks ~Dovie âºï¿½?? 
Lisa ...I have recently started watching your videos and love them so much.. Â Can you give me some advice... I have bird lips... skinny lips.. and now that I am in my fifties, I now love the pinky nude lipsticks.but would love to have fuller lips. I was thinking about lip injections. Â Your lips are perfect. Have you had any experience with lip injections? Hope to hear from you... ty? 
I need you to do a dental care video, please. Your teeth are absolutely flawless!? 
On the Rag and Bone do the wyatts rub on your toes?? 
I think you would love the Whitening Lightening lip glosses. Great consistency! Kind of &quot;sticky&quot; but like it&#39;s going to stay put. The nude is so pretty. I love watching you!? 
Hi Lisa, I like that lip color. Have you tried the Dior nude lip color called SWAN? It is also a great texture.? 
Congrats on the weight loss!? 
I love all the products u showed!! Specially the lipstick in a tube don&#39;t know the name? It was really pretty on u! You look really good! Great job on the weight loss! Don&#39;t loose any more take care love your video Dolly? 
Just found your channel via heyclaire ... and so happy I did :) Absolutely loving your hauls. You give fantastic descriptions of products and make me want to try new things! You are so lovely!? 
That Armour color lip gloss was really pretty ans so was sexy mother pucker ! Bite lipstick in fig was very beautiful also .Thank you.? 
OMG! I audibly gasped when I saw the Wyatt sandals on you! Barneys had &#39;em on sale so I scooped up a pair and I&#39;m wearing them now. I own A LOT of shoes and can honestly say that these are one of my absolute faves!! EVER! Also, Target has some new (to me?) tanks that I think you&#39;ll love. They&#39;re spaghetti strap but the drape is awesome. Reminds me of AW t&#39;s. I couldn&#39;t find the link but they&#39;re in the women&#39;s tank section. You&#39;ll know when you feel them. Thanks!! Loving you from here in Greensboro, NC!? 
Hi Lisa, I can&#39;t find this top your wearing in this video at any Gap. Even emailed the Gap with a link to this video lol..they had no idea what top it is. Can you help? Thanks!? 
What a refreshing person. Great job. Just found you so this is the first video I&#39;ve watched of yours. I&#39;ll be back. You are awesome!? 
LOved the nude lip stuff.Â  Thank you.Â ? 
Love the look of the day! Â Perfect summer look!? 
OMG the sunglasses look so cool on you! So bright and summery! Love them! :-D? 
20 lbs!? Amazing Lisa! Wow! Congrats! Â You look amazing (but looked amazing before too!).<br /><br />How tall are you?<br /><br />Love the new shoeties, so awesome! Â And those jeans look great. Â My faves are always the clothes &amp; shoes you share :)<br /><br />Take care.? 
Congrats on losing 20 lbs. Those jeans look really good on you and the nude Rag &amp; Bone sandals OMG they&#39;re cute. I think I&#39;d like nude better than black. The tulip dress from Gap is cute. I&#39;ll check it out. Thks again. You always give us good ideas on how to put things together.? 
I think the Armor Lip-gloss looks wonderful on you? 
Loved this video! Like you, I&#39;m a small frame, normally a size 4, but I&#39;ve put 20 lbs on since last summer!(apparently it&#39;s age, I&#39;m 56). I&#39;ve never had to diet before, but started a diet a few weeks ago and have lost only 3 lbs. I was feeling discouraged, but seeing you sitting there all tanned and buff with your cute little bikinis, has inspired me to stay at it! I don&#39;t want to carry excess weight either. I&#39;ve been trying on clothes lately and don&#39;t like how I look in them. So your video has encouraged me to keep at it, 3 down...17 to go! Thanks for doing this video! Do you have a particular sunscreen you use? because I&#39;m a tanner too.? 
LOVE your glasses..such fun!! xx? 
I need to try the Sublime Beauty Brush, Love the Sunglasses and the tulip dress. Those jeans look great on you - perfect that they&#39;re comfortable too! I always enjoy the pics of your beautiful sweet pets at the end of your videos, but what kind is that gorgeous white and yellow flower?? 
Watched your video while in the gym tonight. You helped make the time fly by; you are looking so good and inspiring me! You motivate me with each video, and you probably don&#39;t even realize the impact you have. :))? 
I lost your chanel, so in looking for you, I typed in &quot;makeup video&quot; and return key, then added &quot;clothes&quot;, then added &quot;haul&quot;, then &quot;shoes&quot;Â then &quot;friday&quot; and then&quot;thank you&quot;, after that one of your videos popped up. Â sorry I had forgotten your name. so pleased I found you again because your videos are so good, thank you!? 
Hi Lisa, I just recently subscribed to your channel! You are theÂ ONLY person I&#39;ve found on youtube that likes the same brands and types of things I do. I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to do these videos because I love watching them!? 
I have that exact same dry brush and love it! I actually ordered those Gap tanks earlier in the week. They don&#39;t sell them in my store. I hope I ordered the right size because all the reviews said to size down. Love that lip color on you! xo? 
Lisa you would really love the new Pureology line called Strength Cure (it&#39;s in a blue bottle). Â It&#39;s amazing... after two washes my hair is completely different. Â ? 
Lisa, what is your favorite good neutral every day crease color - but a cool toned one, not too warm? Â Like the one in the Naked Basics palette. You mentioned Bobbi Brown &quot;Naked&quot; but that seems somewhat warm toned. Â What else do you like? Â Maybe the Shiseido &quot;Lingerie&quot; you have mentioned in the past?? 
Lisa you are so motivating I love watching your videos and thanks for introducing me to chemicals peels because my skin hasn&#39;t looked this nice since high school? 
I&#39;ve tried dry brushing and it HURTS, no matter how gentle I am. I&#39;ll be curious to see how you like it!? 
Ahhh I LOVE that Bite Beauty one!!! Thanks for showing such a great variety of products. You&#39;re awesome!? 
Lisa, what style name is your tshirt?? 
You&#39;re always chatty! That&#39;s what we love about you :)? 
Those sunglasses look amazing on you! I love them on you! Perfect Lisa!!! :-)? 
Cute new sunglasses! I really hope that you stop losing weight, you always look good but I think you are starting to shrivel away. :(Â ? 
LOVE the sunglasses. I just got the pink strip Victoria Secret iphone case that has a solid pink on the edges.? 
lisa lisa lisa!!! Im from the uk,been watching your vids for years!!! eeek,Â  just got home there and my rachel k cc cream neutral has arrived! soo excited to put it on under my bare minerals powder tomorrow!!! made me think of you straight away!! ill let u know how i get on!!!! :-) xox? 
Hi Lisa, I&#39;ve been desperately trying to locate this white top of yours at the Gap. Can you help me? Do you have a style # or name of it to help me find it? Thanks!? 
Just started watching your channel. You are amazing and I&#39;m hooked, lol. Your personality shines right through. Stay beautiful Lisa! ? 
Lisa I love your videos so much! You are such an inspiration :) You&#39;re one of the reasons I decided to start my own channel! Thank you for being you!? 
Hi Lisa, I love the Gap t-shirt you are wearing.Â  I searched for it online and could not find it.Â  Would you mind letting me know the style # or any other product info. so the store can ID it.Â Â  Thank you!? 
Great stuff as always, congrats on the weight loss!!ð? 
Hey Lisa, get a sample of Clinique&#39;sÂ Stay-Matte Oil-Free Makeup. The shade &quot;Honey&quot; is beautiful! I think this might work for you plus it won&#39;t make you break out like MAC does. It&#39;s my current fave, layered with bare-minerals on top.? 
I love those sunglasses on u!!!? 
I purchase my dry brush from Target, I thought you might want an accessible alternative. The one at Target has a handle which you can remove and it looks just like the one you purchased from amazon for under $5 bucks. Have a great weekend, Lisa :)? 
Around the first of the year I weighed about 130 and I got soooooo sick of people telling me I needed to eat a cheeseburger that I have gained 20 pounds and I am sooo uncomfortable. I am going to drop those 20 pounds and tell anyone that doesn&#39;t like it to stuff it! I know the last time you lost weight people said something about it so I know you will understand what I mean. Lisa, you look beautiful at any size and now that I look at pics of myself I like me better at 130 too!Â  &lt;3? 
Lisa I&#39;m loving those sunglasses you got! The pink on the rims and sides are sooo cool! You are looking so glowy and beautiful, love it! &lt;3Â ? 
Love your outfit of the day and those sun glasses ruled!? 
I just love when you try on the lip colors , gives me a better idea of ones I need to get myself lol , I&#39;m a sucker for a great nude lip ;) ? 
I should have missed something... What&#39;s the brand of the cabana crush gloss?? 
Those jeans look great on you!!!!! I need them!!!! You look great Lisa!!!! Lots of love! Xxxx? 
Hi Lisa<br />I hope you don&#39;t mind but can you tell me what t-shirt you are wearing, I ask because I noticed the arm pit is low and its hard to find these kinds,Â  the name, you said it was from Gap. thanks<br />loveRose? 
<span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" oid="107941368141195470099">LisaLisaD1</a></span>Â download The Hunt to find those cute shoes that Sofia Vergara is wearing in the Womens Health magazine. Â You can find just about anything there. Â I am happy you bought the Vitality Face Disk! Â I love everything about it, especially the highlighter. Â I use it on my pout and inner eye, it&#39;s amazing.? 
New email customers get 10% off? 
I really like the Bite lipstick on you Lisa. Â I would of thought fig would be to brown but that looks kinda rosy on you. Â I&#39;m gonna give it a try too.? 
Pretty lip products. I can not get enough of them:) Your makeup looks beautiful.I have a magazine obsession. They inspire me a lot. InStyle and Vogue are my favorites. The skin brushing sounds neat. I&#39;m going to try it! Those sunglasses are cute. It&#39;s neat how you try on the lip colors. Real time swatches:) Great video as always.? 
Need to look into that dry brushing!!! Have heard so much about it!!! Some nice goodies this week as usual, Lisa...Happy 3 day Weekend to you and your family :)))? 
you look so great lisa! you can see the weight you&#39;ve lost and it looks amazing..love the new jeans and booties.Â ? 
The last color is the best , I think.? 
i was finally out looking at makeup again a few days ago (1st time in a long time) with a friend and i saw that laura mercier lip color you bought (flushed). i was instantly drawn to it too,Â  but when i tried it on; my friend right away told me it looked awful on me..lol...i then found myself at the chanel counter bc i wanted to look at their new collection (i&#39;d seen some things on a YT video) and sure enough, fell in love with the cream shadow in &quot;new moon&quot;!! i also was looking at those les beiges bronzers and they were beautiful! i also saw a new shade of cream blush that was really pretty.Â  &quot;cheeky&quot;..very natural and nice. i love the formula of their cream blushes, but am not into most of the colors.Â  unfortunately, i was just window shopping on that visit, or i&#39;d have picked up a few things!Â  :(Â  my budget is extremely small, so i see only 1 thing at a time in my future, so that being said; the cream shadow will be the winner for sure!? 
I just have to say you are my new best friend. I love your channel. Your reviews are sooo good. I just enjoy everything about it. ? 
Thank you so much for showing those tulip dresses I&#39;m gonna check those out right now and what a beautiful tribute at the end to our military wives and children! God bless! ;)? 
like the sexy Â motherpucker really makes your lips look very niceee? 
FYI Â ECOTOOLS also has an awesome-- body brush on amazon, its round and seems to be a little bigger?? Â I have used it for a little over a year and really like it!? 
Hey Lisa~<br />I love this whole look on you, so simple and chic!? 
Congrats on the 20lbs!!! You look amazing! You do no matter what size but I can see how happy you are, just a complete glow from within! Those jeans are perfection on you! If they sell other colors you should splurge on some more because you look hella sexy in them! I wrote down most of those lipstick/glosses you showed so I can pick up one or two but I most definitely want a pair of those sunglasses, omg I&#39;m just in love with those!! Hugs and love &lt;3? 
Lisa I watch you every saturday night here in Australia!Â <br />It&#39;s one of the things that excites me haha :) Your base is looking really tasteful lately.Â ? 
Lisa, you should check out Bikini Body Mommy here on YouTube. She has workout videos that are short but effective. Great for us busy mommies. ? 
Lisa, you so lovely and your videos bring so much joy to my life :) xx? 
I love ur video&#39;s &amp; you look very sexy with ur pretty jeans &amp; perfect with those nice looking shoes B-) ? 
Hi Lisa! Do you mind posting the link to the Gap tee? I can&#39;t seem to find that one :(? 
I love your makeup in this video. Would love a tutorial ? 
I love the soap and glory in nudist. It is my favorite thing to put over any nude lip to brighten it. It&#39;s just the perfect nude shade. I love bite beauty and own fig and it is so beat up from the heat here in Texas. They melt really easily so I would avoid keeping them in your purse during the summer months. I love air kiss from clinque. It&#39;s an old faithful for me. I love your hauls :) ? 
Congrats on your weight loss you look amazing. I want those jeans and booties so bad!!! Loved you? 
I love all the lip colors. I really can&#39;t choose a favorite. You look beautiful in anything. You could literally rub concealer across your lips and pull it off. lol You are so gorgeous.Â ? 
Nice thigh gap Lisa!? 
Lisa, you are blessed with the most calming, soothing personality! I bet you are able to bring folk&#39;s high blood pressure way down. ;) Of course we both know it has to do with a Southern lady&#39;s charm~?

Hi lisa love your videos ! I have dry skin would the Mac fluid foundation be good on dry skin ? Or is it more suitable for oily skin! Thanks ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ðð? 
Lauren! Don&#39;t feel like you have to justify your purchases. You can buy whatever you want from whatever brand. :-) ? 
I agree with you!! I need to get out of my comfort zone too? 
Love your videos! You seem like one of the most genuine and &#39;real&#39; YouTubers out there.<br />Much love from Australia xx.? 
Love the haul! We also have a summer haul video on our channel, check it out! :)? 
Could you do a &#39;how I curl my hair&#39; video?Â¿? 
please can I just have her closet? 
Lauren&#39;s wardrobe is goals? 
<a was such a Phoebe Buffay moment!? 
the watch is beautiful ? 
you say &#39;because&#39; like khloe kardashian? 
Please do a tutorial on your everyday loose curls!!? 
Will you do a video where you show us the outfits you like and how you would pull them all together with accessories and the colors. Because I like your style but I don&#39;t know what to look for and how to make them look good thanks manð? 
What is your background music called in this video??? 
Any idea where her top is from?? 
&#39;I could never be a model&#39; <br /><br />...yes you could, you&#39;re like perfectï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?? 
BRB going to Nordstroms and buying everything? 
Your soo close to 1 million subs!!!!? 
that watch was $595 HAHAHA? 
My favorite pieces to wear right now are jackets and baggy t-shirts. Jackets because you can just be wearing a plain shirt and throw a jacket on and then you have a nice and complete outfit. I like baggy t-shirts because I am really into the lazy look and I can find really cool ones at the thrift store.? 
Acid wash jeans, and those pants that are loose at the top but right at the bottom (my friends call them poo-catchers ð)? 
lauren you are so close to 1 M !!!? 
Beautiful Lauren, love your style!! can you tell me please where your t-shirt is from? been searching one that color EVERYWHERE? 
Love you Lauren ? 
I knew this was a sponsored video...? 
I&#39;m so late wow !? 
Hello beautiful Lauren Elizabeth of the Internet you are just so so so so SO amazing wow!? 
I really missed these kinds of videos. I love her style and I wish she had more videos about it. IG and Twitter doesn&#39;t do it justice. ? 
Does anyone know where those shoes are from? I loooove them? 
You should do a video about how you workout and eat in a day, because your just like body goals and I don&#39;t even want to wear a crop top because I have a lump on my stomach&#39;!!!!!!? 
where were the sandals from?? 
Recently I&#39;ve been loving simple patterned fabric shorts from Target OMG they are so comfy and cute especially with a simple top and white vans? 
How long did it take u to learn how to spell ur last name is is taking me FOREVER ? 
fitness routine please!!!!!!!? 
Ughhhhhh love. You. We have the same style so thanks for the hauls!? 
I would suggest Kimonos just because since u love wearing t-shirts n jeans u can dress it up with a kimono n u will still b comfortable n at the same time it&#39;s cute. N also just layer necklaces n wear ur jewelry it will definitely look put together. Loved everything u got!!!ððï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?? 
Love your videos ((:?

I love the nail polish she is wearing! Which brand and color is it?? 
Love your videos Lauren! Honestly look forward to every time you post. My staple item right now has to be my ripped light wash jeans from urban. They fit nicely and don&#39;t have that weird loose fit on my waist but tight on the legs look. I love rolling them up :). Also, I&#39;ve been wearing more rose gold jewelry. I think that with your tan skin it would look amazing on you! Love youðð?

Hi loves! Not sure why the video starts 3 mins. in...but anyways hope you enjoy! Thanks for watching!! Xoxo? 
lol rag and bone suck? 
Daymn he ugly!!? 
Boring! I am in m serious NEED of seeing Miuccia&#39;s Vogue Voices or Ghesquiere&#39;/? 
Talented jerks, so its all good. 
I hate these guys. They are jerks. 
Worst of the lot so far... Was everyone else too busy or what?

Rag &amp; Bone is my favee 
&quot;We&#39;re trying to make cool shit&quot;. I think that&#39;s one of the best ways I&#39;ve heard to think about it. 
Rag and Bone jeans...the BEST, they make the outfit! 
you are hilarious. ......!!!Â ? 
Thanks for the video! I&#39;m tempted to try the W&amp;B jeans, love the wash and distressed look. I&#39;ve had good luck w 7 for all mankind for a good, lighter weight selvedge Japanese denim jean. They seem fairly easy to care for, a cold machine wash isn&#39;t usually a problem. Â Any thoughts on the 7s vs. the W&amp;B? Are the W&amp;B&#39;S worth a shot for $300? Also, if you like the Cone&#39;s White Oak stuff, Jack Spade (a little pricy) makes a good jean.? 
This was a great help, thank you :) 
wow. Anais looks great and perfect for the campaign 
love this look. where is the belt from?? 
What song is this? Love the pants btw!! 
Love it! What a great idea! 
Did a awesome job! Looks great. I got these same pair of pants on sale at JCPennys a few months ago! 
stunning as always,you are a bomb baby *_* 
Very pretty!!! 
super cute and fresh !! Love your ootd as always!!! 
Love this outfit &quot;) 
Hi Lisa, ...what type of &quot; backless bra &quot; are you wearing if you don&#39;t mind me asking?Â  The dress fits beautifully, so most women would need a great backless bra. Thx! Viv? 
I love your boots!? 
Lisa you are an absolute fox! 
Do you still like you newbury boots? which color did you keep. Did you ever end up trying the vince camuto to compare? thanks... love the shoes. 
Thank you very much! :)) Lisa 
Ur so beautiful!! 
please please please do your favorite lip liner and lipsticks as of now. AS MANY as youd like! lol 
Oh to be a housewife....the only stress you have is about your hair. XD 
Your are so hot! :O... your a M.I.L.F!&lt;3 
Owwww* 
Owen Lisa one of my cats had ringworm also, and it&#39;s treatable it took me 2 months to treat. My vet used a special Sulfate solution, maybe that agency is not treating them right. 
Love the walnut!!! 
You have had so many great comments today Lisa and I have to concur.... You ROCK that dress. You look like a model yourself!!!!! I LOVE the walnut boots!!!! I have a pair similar to them and almost exactly the walnut color. My favorite look in the world and I get so many compliments, is with a &quot;walnut-tanish&quot; maxi dress and my &quot;boyfriends&quot; black wool sweater. OMG. It makes me rush the thought of Autumn. I would also splurge on myself and get the chili color boots too!!!! I have a cognac leath 
HEY LORI!! Thank you so much, I love it!! I hope you had a great time, I cannot imagine a 2 week cruise!! Glad you&#39;re back--thanks again!! xoxo Lisa 
walnut looks beautiful! black is quite &quot;blaah&quot; 
I would not complain at all if I woke up tomorrow and looked like Rosie Huntington Whiteley. Not sure if I spelled her name right. What is wrong with people? She is gorgeous.  
I just got home from my 2 wk cruise and saw this video and thank you so much for the mention and I&#39;m so happy you love the bracelet. I have a lot of video catching up to do! xoxo - Lori 
Black boots are much more versatile! They&#39;re beautifu! 
Lisa, what kind of bra can you wear with that low back dress? I need to find a bra that works for my backless dresses! P.s. you look so beautiful today in that outfit! :) 
I use to get that Magazine when I lived on that side of the pond. But for anyone in the UK - you can get it in WH Smiths. 
Sometime ago didnt you buy a lipliner from Toofaced that you liked very much, have you stopped using that for your dior one ? 
Hey Lisa, You can get advice from your subscribers about your hair- but should do what is right for you. You are the one who has to live with you own hair. I do think that you would look good with shorter hair. You rock what you like. We all have different styles. I love watching your videos. I enjoy seeing your jewely hauls. So continue to rock being you. 
Those boots are so perfect! They just went on my Bday &amp; Christmas lists! LOL I&#39;ve been looking for the perfect bootie FOREVER!!!! 
Omgosh I say pick black over the walnut. I loooove the black!!!! You should get a Facebook to chat about shopping beauty and etc :) 
you&#39;re so cute! I love the walnut color! 
Hey Lisa! Im really interested to see how you put an outfit together with that skirt. I don&#39;t quite have the vision you have when it comes to fashion so it would be really neat to see the skirt in an outfit of the day!! 
LOVE that dress on you, so elegant and you make every simple dress look so va-va-boom 
Oh one more thing... I was just sitting here at my desk at work eating my lunch and watching your video and my co-worker that sits behind me, he sent me an instant message that said &quot;What are you doing over there... watching Pam Anderson do her laundry?&quot; because you were holding up the skirt you bought. Haha I thought you&#39;d get a kick out of that. I said &quot;She does look a lot like her doesn&#39;t she?&quot; Have a great day! 
I love that hat Rhonda sent you - so cute! I also wanted to let you know that your new haircut looks amazing. I know you miss your long hair, but you&#39;re already making the new cut your own and I think you&#39;re going to learn to really love it. Plus it must be so nice to feel your hair in a more healthy state. Boof it up with those curls and you&#39;re good to go! 
This dress is awesome!I love everything with an open back or an interesting back!Omg those rag&amp;bone shoes are perfect!Blacks are perfect and worn off is better too.Rachel Bilson wears them and looks great!I like also walnut cause it&#39;s edgy as a style but classy as a color.Chilly I am not to crazy for.Hope I helped!Love you bye bye! 
I&#39;m glad you got the *Nude Beach* I love mine, &amp; don&#39;t really do too well with nudes. I&#39;m also lipsticked out..lol..I need to stay OUT of the mall! 
Ok sorry I do not like the boots they remind me of the boot that al pachinko wears 
Is he a Maine coon? He&#39;s gorgeous! 
Hi lisa if you do decide to do clip in extentions.foxy locks is a great brand.just google them.love you and your videos 
Lisa - I really enjoy the new haircut on you. It&#39;s very fresh looking. And my vote for the boots is definitely black but I would probably keep them both! Lol. I&#39;m going to order the black ones now! Have you tried the new Bobbi Brown BB cream yet? 
making a decision about what basic color boot to get is SO hard!!! but i vote for the black!!! xo 
Keep the black ones! 
Omg your legs, wow! 
Lisa.. If you are interested in hair extension I got mine from Sally&#39;s. They are clip in and are really good quality!! BTW.. I Live near MB too!!! 
You look phenomenal! Your hard work is paying off. Love the dress. It reminds me of something Samantha from Sex and the City would wear. Have you ever been to Manhattan? You should come shopping! Haha. 
THANK YOU, so much!! Tell your boyfriend HEY for me!! I appreciate your sweetness and support!! xoxo Lisa 
i don&#39;t always love black shoes either but the walnut are to die for! 
Hey Lisa, Went to Nords to look at the Vince Camuto boots but they were only online :-( I think I may still order them! 
Thank you!! I just told Brooke today--&quot;the sooner you learn to love the way YOU LOOK, the happier you will be&quot;---she is at that age---she want to look like everyone else!! Thanks again!! xoxo Lisa 
It doesn&#39;t get much better than that!! Thanks for sharing them with us!! xoxo Lisa 
wow love the hair and the boots!!! all the colors are gorgeous have a great week Lisa 
As a guy with blond hair and blue eyes, I&#39;ll never understand this near racist obsession the media keep having with the Aryan woman. :-/ 
I say keep the boots- both are neutrals so you can wear them with everything! I love the look of the dress but the way the straps are never work for me- always falling:( love that skirt!!! Looking forward to meeting the new baby:):):) 
Hey lisa! It is Thundash. I am really sorry about the kitty situation. Hope everything works out. Poor Chanel. :&#39;( 
Hey Lisa :) I want to say thanks again for making all the videos you do, your cheerfulness and positivity always rubs off on me. -Sara 
I prefer the walnut color. 
really want to know what u think of jane iredale bb cream 
Hey Lisa! I found these at They look to be very similar to the Rag and Bone Newbury but at a much better price. Wish they had more colors though! Bandolino - Joinedtome Booties 
Keep the boots..You will use both...I wish wish wish I could get them..enjoy them.. 
Keep them both!! (Boots) LOVE em!! 
I love your hair long but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be just as gorgeous shorter. I love both boots, such a hard choice. Personally I would stick with the walnut (because I have mostly darker jeans and I don&#39;t like dark shoes and jeans together on me) love that dress! 
I love your new hair!!! It looks SO good on you!! Holy Cats! Your dress is divine. I usually love brown boots, but in this case, I would not be able to choose, because I like the black ones too. Surprisingly, because I don&#39;t normally like black shoes or bags. I&#39;m definitely checking out the lipsticks...sounds just what I love. The kitty is so cute and active! I remember when mine was like that and she still is sometimes. She&#39;s 15. I love your videos! Keep them coming! ~~Susan~~ 
Love the new haircut! 
keep both the boots Lisa, they are lovely. you are looking beautiful as usual. 
black..love that give on that leather... 
Those walnut boots are perfect!! 
Beautiful as always! Could you please do a video featuring what sort of bras you wear for dresses like the one you&#39;re wearing in this video? 
Hey Lisa-I rarely comment on videos but I watch all of your videos. I absolutely love you! Even my bf now recognizes your voice from me constantly watching. He will say &quot;Hows lisalisad today?&quot; lol. But it just get to me to hear you have to deal w/&quot;haters&quot;. I just have to assume they are jealous. You are so genuine and down to earth and I just want you to know how much I appreciate you doing you despite what anyone might think or say.I know I am not alone on that one! Have a great weekend! -Sarah 
oh yes and the black leather was all over the fall runways! 
I&#39;m a boot lover 2 I would keep them all lol dress is pretty the back looks so sexy, and Bubba is awesome! 
Lisa--I love your shorter hair! I&#39;m thinking about getting some inches taken off at my next appointment. Have a great Sunday. xoxo Sue 
Keep everything..it&#39;s all Gorgeous!! ..xoxo 
omg that cat is gorgeous! 
I would keep the black just so I can style it with a little more, it could be dressy or casual. The walnut seems a bit casual for me. 
That dress is a knock out on you Lisa! You have such a big heart and are doing such a great thing by adopting your kitties! It just broke my heart to hear about little Chanel! I hope you don&#39;t give up on her, I&#39;m sure she could really use some lovin right now. Hope she gets well soon. Love the new hair cut and looking forward to meeting the new member of the family! Xoxo Christine 
send the black ones back! 
What bra did you wear with the Samantha dress being that it is so low in the back? Thanks. 
Love the boots...keep them al!! Lol u once again look stunning!!!!! 
The boots look so soft. I would definitely keep the Walnut and Chili at least. I already bought one of the Too Faced lipsticks and am hoping to go back for a couple more, and a liner. 
I hear ya on the whole &quot;beauty&quot; topic I have had a few talks too with my daughter she will be 9 next month and glad we started those talks early as I think too is so important for kids to know its ok to be an individual and being and liking different things from others is perfectly ok as everyone does have different styles and that&#39;s what makes it interesting as it would be boring if we all looked and dressed the same. I remind her just because you may not like something someone is wearing does 
cute kitty i love him 
Where is your dress from? Who makes it? 
You are beautiful :) xx emily 
I prefer the chestnut boots , I think your hair would look great cut straight to your shouldeers. Thank you for the review on too faced lipstick. 
Like the haircut. Sometimes it&#39;s best to just go ahead and cut it off...it just revives when you do that - I bet it feels great! 
Please do. Video on your weight loss 
Definitely get the black!!! So chic and they look so comfy and soft! 
Lisa, you have an amazing heart! I&#39;m so glad I found you on YouTube! Great job! 
Your gorgeous so sorry about little chanel 
LOVE the dress, shoes, handbag and the boots!!!! Keep all three, they are all so beautiful!!! I love the black, may have to order them!!! 
Hi Lisa! Have you ever tried the TEMPTU airbrush foundation? Some people claim that it stayes on skin forever and does not get oily. 
Hey Lisa! I think that cutting it straight across, and wearing it straight would look amazing on you, and you could still wave it..;) You look beautiful girl! 
i feel sorry for chanel and the other baby. ): hope they get better soon and hopefully you can have a new friend in the house as well! :) the last picture of your little monster is adorably funny! haha 
coming back from going out today and finishing your video. :D those rag &amp; bone boots are beautiful! very simple and you&#39;re right that it&#39;s not too western which is probably why i like them! i love rag&amp;bone jeans/leggings too. it&#39;s so dang soft. much better than j brand to me. haven&#39;t tried citizens of humanity yet, but i don&#39;t want to since i&#39;m scared i may like them! haha i definitely think i prefer the walnut colour. it looks especially nice. i mean, black is such a common colour. 
Lisa if you google Catherine Zeta Jones you will find two different photos of her wearing the Chilli Newburys with, not that you need inspiration ;) Noticed your subs were over 30,000 congrats, I remember when it was around 5,000 when I first found you!!!! 
You got some great things and products I want to try! And I&#39;m jealous of your kitties! 
Wow. Bubba is going to be a big kitty:) That&#39;s really sad about Chanel:( I hope they don&#39;t have to put her down. Your hair is so pretty without the extensions. The beach hat is going to look great on you. I agree with what you said about beauty. It&#39;s sad how young the bullying starts. My daughter gets a hard time because I always put her long hair up. I liked the tan boots best. It&#39;s so fun watching your Friday Hauls. I always get ideas. Your outfit looked stunning. 
I love the brown boots &amp; love the new cut &amp; I cant wait for details on styling as that is the same lenght as mine... 
Don&#39;t cut your beautiful hair.. just trim until the layers match up.. love the tea towel, &amp; every outfit item in this .. I love the walnut &amp; the black.. so start singing Happy Birthday to ME!!!Great video.. 
Lisa omg I love your new haircut (very chic) you need to tell us what bra or what kind of support you are wearing under that very sexy dress, which looks amazing on you. Now I suggest you keep both pair of boots , because in winter black boots are very handy to have. Cheers Amaya 
YOu cut your hair! 
Lisa you look great &amp; so thin.. Can u do a video on ur diet/workout 
Hey Lisa, love your new Doooooooooooooooooo!!!! That is very brave of YOU! Love JA :o) x

I love your taste. I splurge on bags. Buy it in a different color syndrome, yeah I&#39;ve been there, too. Can I share with you a women&#39;s clothing site that I found and so far have really liked? Sign up using this link <a and you will get a $10 credit on your first purchase. Try them out I think you&#39;ll find cute designer clothes at affordable prices. :)?

What is her twitter?????? I NEED IT? 
I love her ððð? 
I like this thing on your hand. Are you Jewish? Cause they&#39;re the ones who wear stuff like that.? 
At least Meghan on nyquil has good taste. Haha? 
So she spent like over $1000 on these things. excuse me while i go cry in the corner? 
r u drunk? or is this normal? <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" 
$2,267 is a lot of money for what you bought, I honestly hope you are okay. I&#39;m not judging, but I just hope you can afford to do that. Because it could ruin your life.? 
hey meghan!<br />stumbled across your channel today and I love it! I just wanted to ask if that&#39;s a Pandora ring that you&#39;re wearing in this video (the two-tone ring with beaded band and single diamond). I&#39;m debating on getting that ring too and I really love the way you wear it :]? 
am i the only one who noticed she has something black on olivia..? 
I actually like the messy look of your hair? 
What size shoe are you ? ? 
your budget is goals? 
I&#39;ve always loved you&#39;re hair color and i recently got it done similar to yours! I love it so much, thanks for the inspiration!!!? 
Is it just me or does she look skinnier..? just asking (no hate)? 
I have big feet too (size 9.5/10) and I feel like I&#39;m the only one in the world. All my friends have normal sized feet :-/? 
You&#39;re soo hilarious!!! ððï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?? 
Olivia be lookin gooooood!? 
I&#39;m in love with that black and blue necklace!! ?

Staying home in ct... Snow,snow and watching reruns of Lisa....sooo fun 
Hey Lisa, Do you still have the Tarte palette from Ulta? I remember that from so long ago, did you end up keeping that? 
love your accent, your so beautiful &lt;3 
@whatanightmare1 Thank you, and thank you for watching--I know my vids are long!! xoxo Lisa 
and ur cat is too beautiful &lt;3 
That Michael Kors bag is soooooooooo beautiful! 
Your skin is absolutely incredible! 
You look amazing! I swear...your skin looks glowing and sooo smooth. I love your chuckle too. Have a wonderful Christmas season. Much love, Susan 
Thank you so much for the bra recommendation! It looks like I&#39;m stopping at VS tomorrow! :) 
Tell John, once he goes Mac, he&#39;ll never go back! LoL! Hugs, Damaris 
Lisa, sweetrags online has the black version of the perfume bottle tank top but it has a silver sequin bottle, just letting you know because I have the black and love it! 
You look so beautiful in this video. 
LOVE YOUR CAT! 
I LOOVE follow me around videos! 
Just watch out for flash photography with that HD powder--silica flashes back white! Also, that&#39;s all the HD powder is--silica--so you can get it waaaay cheaper. Just did a 4-way split for a bunch of those Chanel cream shadows (poor college student and whatnot); can&#39;t wait to try them! That kitty! &lt;3 ALSO, this is totally random, but I was watching Aaja Nachle today and I realized that you kind of remind me of a blonde Madhuri Dixit (but without the dancing ;). 
Thanks so much for the bra recommendation. I&#39;ve been looking for a new one. The Victoria&#39;s secret one I have has way too much padding. Please recommend your favorite Hourglass product for me to try out since I can&#39;t make the long trip to your event. Your pep talk was great! Thanks so much for sharing!~Dana 
U are def a style inspiration to me I adore all you wear!!! thanks for doing what you do! Oh and Brigitte is adorable. my niece adopted a similar looking chichaua and she named her &quot;sparkles princess&quot;, 
love you in that color! enjoy your meetup! :) 
hi lisa you are so cute i love all ur videos ! 
The iPhone is very easy to use.... You will get it !! Enjoy it 
My kitty has no tail either! He just twirls that little nub! I gotta get that Michael Kors gift so cute! Totally worth it for the bag! Ummm those funky jeans are so cute! Totes need to see them in an outfit! Welcome to the iPhone world! Yes the video feature is in the Camera App and at the bottom right hand corner you can chose photos or videos. Slide button to the right and then your in the video mode! We&#39;ll help ya out girl! 
I love your style! â¥~Tonya 
In the dec issue for in style mag there is an advertisement for those estee lauder eye shadows that says that can be used wet or dry ? which I never new until I saw that..maybe that would make it darker for you??( LOVE your kitty : D).... 
For the video camera in the iPhone, go to your camera and in the lower right corner there&#39;s a little switch from camera to video camera . Just switch that and by the way! My fiancÃ© just bought me the champaign fossil watch and also a beaded tiffanys bracelet. I love them together!! Thanks 
NOt usually a fan of the rolled up leg but you look fab today Gernerally think the jeans needs to be hemmed. You ware so beautiful lisa! 
Lisa, GossMakeup just did a video on that HD powder. Pretty interesting results when he used a flash photo. 
Hi Lisa, I guess you can tell by my name that I LOVE cats. Pookie is beautiful. I love, love her. You look so pretty Lisa. I wonder what other stores carry the Korres bag. I will call around tomorrow. You are right about the bra thing. I have to try on a million bras to find one. 
P.S. Your kitty is so beautiful! Such beautiful, velvety fur! Bridget really looked like she thought she was getting away with something. Lol! Too cute! 
Lots of fun goodies! Love your outfit how you had it fixed at the end! Congrats on your new iPhone 4s! Have fun learning all about it! :+) Vickie 
LOVE LOVE LOVE this outfit! WOW! love that bright blouse with the leopard jacket! WOW!!! YOU GO GIRL!!! ;) 
@KARLSCUTIE Hey Suzanne! John and I are having fun playing with these phones--they are like toys for adults--love it! xoxo Lisa 
@ellamarie84 Thank you, Holly! My dad is the shopper--but my mom got a lot done that day--she could not believe I was wearing these boots to shop in--LOL!! Brigitte is so funny, FULL of personality--she is cuddled up on the couch with Brooke and Will right now--in Heaven!! Have a great night--love ya! Lisa 
@SeventiesGirl1961 Hey there!! John has already taught me so much--he has a co-worker showing him all the fun things--we &quot;asked&quot; it today for a good place to eat--it&#39;s amazing--so much fun!! Thank you for being you!! xoxo Lisa 
Love my iphone!!! You will get the hang of it quicker than you think. It is very user friendly. Also love the outfit with the shirt tucked in. 
&quot;She&#39;s a stinker&quot; LOL. Lisa, you will just love that iPhone4!! Lucky you. But yes, you&#39;ll need to have lessons. My husband and I have the same phones (android) and it is so much better when you can swap tips with each other about your phones and also answer each others&#39; phones etc. when needed. You look smashing in this video - glowing girl. 
please do a &quot;my favorite palettes&quot; video and review!! 
@LisaLisaD1 Thanks, my girl. I&#39;ll give it a go :) ~Trish~ 
Did you try the Estee Lauder wet? I think you can use it both dry and wet and maybe thats why it was darker. 
Lisa. Could you please do a tutorial on your eye-look here!??!!? I LOVE IT SO MUCH. 
I got the I phone for Xmas gift 2 and I love it :0) 
that is one gorgeous cat!!!! love him! 
I&#39;m blaming you again for making me go out and get the Michael Kors Estess Lauder bag. Each store has a different bag and different shades of the palette and lip colors. I got the gunmetal bag which came with a beautiful palette and pink lip shades. The bronzer is not matte, but it&#39;s lovely anyway. I saw a silver bag at Nordstrom and the gold one, like yours, at Lord &amp; Taylor. 
@cello2glamour Yes! Cacique has really nice bras...I&#39;m a DD, and they have the quality that can hold up the girls! Sadly, they&#39;ve discontinued my favorite deep plunge microfiber bra...:( 
Whoever gets offended by a bra needs to get a grip. LOL! ;) 
What a beautiful kitty! 
I love the blue satin, I bought it this summer when jalapeno2007 raved about it. I love chanel nailpolishes also! 
We can get the Estee Lauder/MK bag with all the goodies in Canada too. The Bay is offering it too, buy a perfume and it&#39;s $44 purchase with purchase. :) 
I don&#39;t find VS bras to be good quality. I guess you&#39;ve had luck with it! 
Your hair and makeup look nice. I really love the lip look. 
I&#39;ve been going to get Blue Satin a bunch of times, but then changed my mind. Seeing you love it makes me want it again! I&#39;m glad your bought the Mirifique. It&#39;s so gorgeous. Definitely one of the best of all Chanel&#39;s new cream shadows. Congrats on the new iPhone! :D xxx 
We don&#39;t have an apple store so no classes. The hubby &amp; I really need to study up on our iphones though. I ordered the MK makeup bag in gold from EL as our Macy&#39;s only has the pewter color - but may have to get it too! They would make good little &quot;going out&quot; bags. I love your big MK bag but I&#39;m not really a gold person and it&#39;s so BLINGY!! I love it though and the &quot;speedy-ness&quot; of it!! Great look today! 
I am in love with your blingy Michael Kors bag!! I need it :) 
I Love the sihrt you were gifted. LOVE LOVE LOVE 
Please do a hair tuturial on the look you have in this video! Love it 
I&#39;m so sad I&#39;m gonna miss the Northlake date at Sephora :( 
Beautiful Cat...do your cats shed? My cats shed way too much. Congrats on the new iPhone you will love it. I had the same feelings as your husband regarding Apple. However, my husband forced me to get rid of my beloved blackberry curve to get the iPhone and now I have to have the new one each time they come out with a new model. I am now learning how to use my new Apple laptop. lol Thank you Lisa fun as usual. You look great. 
What do you do for a living...I love your Vlogs and I&#39;m tuck thinking about what to major in...BUT I would love to have a job where I can shop like you do... love your makeup you look great. 
Wish I could be at your meet &amp; greet I&#39;m in California can&#39;t swing it this week! Happy Holidays â¥ 
Lisa, go on they have a pair of black skinny jeans with a light leopard print pattern over them. they are sexy and subtle. they are funky and I think you would like them!

@ymnitsa I LOVE it, too!! Thanks for watching! :)) Lisa 
I got the same Chanel nail color !!!!!! last week. I love it ))) 
I rewound this vid to show my husband Spooky Bear and Brigitte..they&#39;re too cute! We were laughing at how Brigitte likes to sit on her ottoman throne :) she&#39;s has such a personality. My mom is the same, she is not big on shopping. She is over it after like 2 stores..shopping stamina obviously doesn&#39;t run in the genes bc I could go all day! Love the outfit, I think it looks great w the jeans rolled down, it elongates your legs! Hope u have a great wknd playing with your new iphone! xox ~Holly 
Love the outfit, nice haul, I love my iphone too, when its time for my upgrade I want the white iphone, didn&#39;t have it when Verizon got the iphone in Feb. I went to an iphone class very helpful,l do have the white ipad my Hubby got me,just prefer the white. Have a nice weekend! 
I can&#39;t wait to see those tapered jeans! Can you try them on for us. They look interesting...wondering how they will look on 
LOL and forgot little Bridgey..so cute!! We call our little Parakeet &quot;little stinky&quot;. LOL 
Oh, Lisa, you did get the MK clutch! I got one too! I got the box coffret of little perfumes. My lipstick is a pretty rose and my pallet is purples/pinks/pink blush. Cool tones. Oh, that Spooky Bear is so cute!!! Pretty little white paw and footies! I love the cats that look like velvet! LOVE your Chanel tshirt!! Loved everything you showed/shared!!! Merry Christmas!!

@BlondeGoneBarbie10 Thank you!! :)) Lisa

@mzzclipper12 I&#39;ll bet they are--you will love it! :)) Lisa 
@tdlishy Give this one a try--I usually cannot wear the Body by Victoria because it is too big &quot;around&quot;--too wide--but this one fits great! Thanks for watching! :)) Lisa 
@mzzclipper12 Thank you!! :)) Lisa 
@callmemrsconner I JUST ordered them!! Thank you, I LOVE them!! I got the camel color--Yay! I will probably wear those next weekend to the Hourglass Event--thanks so much! I think the girl probably either did what you said and told me a dinky--or had more of the Bronze tone on than I thought--I am going to try it again, but I am disappointed! Enjoy your day! xoxo Lisa 
LOL weak days are the best shopping days! YAY iPhone!! I would be SO lost (literally - I&#39;m terrible with directions) without mine haha Great outfit! xox 
Aww great stuff Lisa. !!! I love your iphone. Ive been bugging my husband to get me one LOL.  Enjoy all your goodies xoxox lexi 
I can&#39;t see why people get upset by seeing a bra shown or talked about , It certainly doesn&#39;t offend me. You look really beautiful in this video, everytime I watch you seem to look younger :) 
Hi Lisa! I have the iphone 4 and if you go to the regular camera there may be a little slide over bar that changes it from camera to video! i was also wondering if you&#39;ve ever tried the Rich and Skinny Legacy jean! 
@vdon125 This is funny--TheBalm-dot-com--cute!! I just ordered from their online store! :)) Lisa 
@couturemomnyc Okay, Jan--my heart just skipped a beat--WHERE do I get a Chanel cover for my phone??!! I just found the J Brand Houlihans--LOVE them--going to get them--thanks!! Let me know!! â¥ Lisa 
@spygirl43 I am loving the Iphone so far--even the weather is SO LOCAL--LOL--I am like a little kid! Thanks for watching! xoxo Lisa 
Hi Lisa, I got the Estee Lauder/ Micheal Kors bag this week also! Love it. Great outfit, I also have the boots but for me, they are a &quot;short walk to dinner&quot; boot... maybe I&#39;ll try them for a short trip to the mall, have to work myself up to it. The boots are great looking and seem very well made, especially for the price they are now! Hmm, might just have to order my second pair. Have a great week Lisa, wish I was close enough for your meet up! 
@TheTraceReview Hey Girl! Beanie &amp; Cecil--get some!! Did you tell me one time that there is a place here that sells LuLuLemon leggings? Have you tried them? We NEED to get together after the holidays--I know you are busy--went to see &quot;Oliver&quot; last night--:)) Have a great weekend!! â¥ Lisa

Cool haul. Love the black dress on you :)? 
Everyone like soft things :) Such cute clothes. Â Thanks for sharing :)? 
I love your style and everything that you got! &lt;3? 
Julia robert&#39;s long lost daughter?? 
That color is hideous. But they did a good job. 
model is way to skinny! i couldn&#39;t enjoy the clothes. please young woman dont think this is a good look! coming from a woman with a small frame and i eat clean organic foods. 
very well said. I feel as though obesity has become the norm - and because of that, people feel obligated to accept obesity as a normality, and thinness, or even healthiness as a sickness. Obviously, there are many of those out there who are thin and sick, or maybe not so thin, but still sick.... but people barely complain about very curvy women leading an unhealthy lifestyle. I feel as though people choose to be blind when it is more convenient for them. 
I think the comment wasn&#39;t meant to say she is too skinny, it was more that a model has been used and not somebody with a more average figure, obviously there are normal people who are skinny and healthy, but it&#39;s not the majority 
where is alison&#39;s jacket from 
The 3rd is my favvv 
well said friend! 
Allison. You look really good. Like your glowing. Standing next to that model. It was no competition. You stood your ground and was like I can stunt too. I&#39;m bot just the host. Lol. You also look like you have lost weight. If you even felt like needed too. I thought you have always looked great. Keep up the great werk. I live this channel. 
PLEASE DO IT WITH ORANGE JEANS!!! PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 
beautiful look ! 
the second outfit is my favorite &lt;3 
The model looks so awkward moving from pose to pose...I guess that&#39;s why photos work better than video for models... 
60 percent of women in the United States and England are clinically overweight, while 40 percent are clinically obese. Hear disease, which is caused by obesity has become the number one killed of women in America. Compared to that less then .05 percent suffer from anorexia. So which problem do you think we should worry about? I think we need to worry about being too fat. Its causing terrible trouble for us especially in healthcare costs. 
No. She just looks like she is moving around. Its probably not comfortable in those heels. She looks very healthy and pretty. I wish I looked like that. Her legs are so long and graceful. 
the model looks like she&#39;s falling over the whole time. 
holy cow when she crosses her legs they still dont touch o.O 
Snake skin?? thats just sad :( 
loved the 3rd and the 2nd look. 
Thank you i just bought mustard color jeans and i had no idea how to style them. Thank you:) 
The model looks like the blond version of spencer hastings! 
she&#39;s beautiful 
there are skinny and chunky people in this world, when a plus sized model is shown on a video, you dont hear the skinny girls complaining 
have you ever heard of different body types? sure there may be some models that are unhealthily skinny and have an eating disorder, but for many of them, they are naturally skinny and have an ectomorphic body type. 
The model looks like she has to pee. 
I&#39;d tap that ass like a keg of beer. 
The model is so naturally pretty! I love when she smiles. 
I am not gonna judge the model for being stick-skinny cos that is still beautiful. But is there anyone thinks the host was speaking way too fast?? 
I know right! 
I&#39;m not here to judge the way the modelling industry works. I&#39;m just here to defend a poor girl who is clearly being hated/bullied (regardless if she knows that she is or not) just because of the way she looks. It doesn&#39;t matter if she looks unhealthy. That&#39;s not the point. The point here is that people are clearly being ruthless towards her just because of the way she looks. Just because the modelling industry hires only skinny women does NOT give anyone an excuse to make fun of HER. 
well you don`t see fat women modeling clothes for some reason, it is nor beautiful nor healthy, so why do we see women like that modeling clothes? it is clearly not natural 
I completely agree 
THANK YOU! god, for once someone is pointing that. 
The fact that she&#39;s skinny doesn&#39;t make her anorexic or something. I&#39;m as skinny as her and I eat more than my 25 years old bro who&#39;s like 3 times my weight. 
No she wouldn&#39;t. Your comment is really stupid and mean btw. 
Nope just pointing out that people tend to substitute the word &quot;fat&quot; with &quot;curves.&quot; But thanks for your input, so sweet of you to take the time out of your life to comment. 
Thank you so much for your time! It&#39;s so sweet of you to agree with me. 
ewww the model looks disgusting she looks like she has no bones shes all flimsy 
It&#39;s kinda sad how everyone&#39;s making fun of the models weight when they know they would absolutely die to have that figure. This &quot;oh I love my curves&quot; is just people trying to rationalize their unhealthy bodies and eating habits. Jealous bitches, that&#39;s all you are. 
anyone who makes fun of this model for being skinny is just as disgusting as the next person who makes fun of a woman for being &#39;fat&#39;. 
She&#39;s georgeous though 
I wonder, if she tripped and fell, would all her bones break? 
Quick! Someone pin her down and give her a sandwich, Stat!! 
And they say clothes look better on long and thin-NOT! 
Check out my outfit of the day with green jeans! 
For all of you saying that the model is &quot;disgusting&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; because of how thin she is, shame on your ignoramus minds. You are all going with the whole &quot;curves are sexy being thin is gross&quot; trend and shaming someone who is thin. You are saying this because you hate people putting down &quot;thicker&quot; girls yet you contradict yourself and put down a thin model. Being skinny or thick is not gross, it&#39;s the eating disorder that is. All body types are beautiful, fuckers. 
the first outfit made the girl look like a BEE 
love the first and third look! 
the model looks like JULIA ROBERTS :| the skinnier younger version!!! 
her legs...soo tin 
loved the bright side... hated the others 
They&#39;re not tight enough. 
i love her.. 
People... I don&#39;t think she&#39;s trying* to look awkward.D: She&#39;s switching from pose to pose---best for photo modeling. But with video modeling.. it looks... well, awkward. Bright-side: ^_^ The outfits were nice &lt;3 
love the outfit so much 
her pants look too short 
@ybbed019 because you&#39;re a hipster &lt;_&lt; 
the model can barely stand, poor thing... that&#39;s a shame because she&#39;s beautiful! (awesome jaw line and eyes) 
I think her awkwardness is kinda cool actually! 
FOR THOSE WHO ATTACK SKINNY PEOPLE do you know you are a good example of a piece of fat meat? 
@freakingtv Ewwww fat! 
@ChiyunLi mean girl..So bad...Being awkward is not what she wanted either. Sayin these things won&#39;t make you a better person, it makes you uglier...who are you to judge her? 
The model is sooooo pretty~ 
love your video!! So great. I subbed please check out my channel and leave feedback and possibly sub back. Thanks 
@ChiyunLi she&#39;s so pretty though! 
@ChiyunLi, There is a difference between giving feedback in a respectful, kind, and constructive way and then there is bullying. First, Simon Cowell is a judge. People go on American Idol knowing they will be judged for their performance. Anyhoo, you aren&#39;t a judge. You clearly weren&#39;t saying a thing that was constructive. So your statement wasn&#39;t warranted. Maybe you will understand what I mean someday. I am not attacking you but the mean vibe I got from you comment. Peace to you. 
@cumensu and NOW you are just cracking me up. Then I guess what Simon says in the American Idol are all bullies. If he doesn&#39;t think somebody&#39;s got sharp performance, he says it. 
@ChiyunLi, if you think that me standing up to bullies is negative then I am dumbfounded. And there is a difference between giving a negative critique of a video and having a mean girl attitude. Well, I guess those are my parting words. 
@cumensu I&#39;m not obligated to give all positive feedbacks to videos, it&#39;s that simple. If I think something can be changed, I can say that as long as I want to. BTW, the way you are attacking me is prob more negative than anything. 
@ChiyunLi, still who asked you for your negativity? 
darren criss can wear yellow denim better than anybody &lt;3 
@cumensu Well does it mean that everyone HAS to like the model??? This is ridiculous. Thanks to you, otherwise I would&#39;ve not realized that many people thumbed it up...Well then a lot of people agree..it&#39;s that simple 
That model is scary skinny!!! Whoa!!! Even her skinny jeans were baggy!!! 
the model&#39;s gorgeous! &lt;3 
umm...what if you don&#39;t have skinny legs :( 
Love these tips! Gonna look for some mustard skinny jeans asap! 
it only looks amazing coz she&#39;s got such a nice figure :D 
wow that model is freaking skinny, no beyond skinny! 
@turquoiseyou She&#39;s just really hungry. 
The model is GORGEOUS 
@ChiyunLi, who asked you and all the people who thumbed up to your comment? 
great choices however a girl that skinny would look good in what ever you put on her! 
LOVE the second and third look. i have red jeans and want green and now i DEF want yellow. gorg! 
Awesome combos!!! 
love the last one 
shes soooooo beautiful but i cant stand her AWKKKKKKARDNESS ! 
The model so stylish love it! 
she&#39;s gorgeous tho 
those pants are ridiculously loose on that model. 
you sound a bit like emma stone... ._. 
just got of pair of teal shorts and I&#39;m in love with them!!!! I just wish I didn&#39;t have to wait till warm weather comes :P 
The model is absolutely gorgeous, don&#39;t be jealous... 
@ChiyunLi she is preety though 
@6524dancer if you re in europe try bershka. 
love it!!! especially the yellow and blue 
I love the last outfit the most! Yellow looks more awesome w blue! The pyramid bag and heels completes evtg. Swoonzzz~ 
It would be a shame for you not to bulk up when other people are able to build muscle so easily with Ready Set Ripped (search for it on google).? 
Last outfit is the best one) have a nice day)? 
Think Justin bieber haha!? 
It looks so cute with the blazer ! Love it !? 
the one you are wearing is the best 
Yes, that could work! Make sure the belt is thick and that you wear them low on your hips so the back pockets sag. 
which ones?! 
I like the look with the blazer the best. 
Where can I get these Jeans ? 
I just got a pair of skinny jeans but they&#39;re a size too large, thus very baggy. If I wear a belt, could it pass as a boyfriend jean? 
thank you for watching! 
The black belt looks great with jeans 
I kinda feel they are interchangable with le jeans. Rock them just the same. Heels are a must. 
what about boyfriend shorts? 
I love them all.thanks for the tips! 
Great tips! 
Love the last outfit!! 
Hi Kimmy. This video was so excellent! I love these jeans and it was awesome to see you pairing it for different occasions with items from affordable (and more expensive) price ranges. Also, I loved the location!! 
These videos are great, it would be awesome if the cameraman could zoom out and show the whole look. 
I enjoy YOU being in them too. 
Great video! :) 
Yes I did!! Congrats!!! I will have to send you another question video! I enjoy being on one of your videos! 
The shoes in the last outfit, oh my, so amazing! 
Love the tips!? 
The blazer

The best outfit was with the blazer. So cute 
You&#39;re the second Kimmy Erin I&#39;ve met!!! AHHHHHH!!!!! #twinsies 
my absolute pleasure, Claudia. xoxo 
ooooo, good one!!! anyone else wanna see that? 
It&#39;s all about the pocket placement and tapered leg this time, AND, having the right shaped waistband so you&#39;re not so boxy. DEF not the smaller size, it&#39;s all about the cut. xoxo 
LOVE YOU for saying that. LOLing and equally flattered. :) 
Thank you! So glad you like! I leave all the deets on my ensembles in the description. &quot;On me: Gap shirt, Devora Libin Jewels bracelets, Rings from H&amp;M and Forever 21, Levi&#39;s Made &amp; Crafted jeans, Barbara Bui belt, Chinese Laundry flats.&quot; smooches! 
Thank you so much for this video! I was thinking about this trend but was sorta freaking out because I didn&#39;t know what to look for. OH and thanks for the shout outs to us shorties!

YAAAAYYYY! So excited! Have no idea where they came from but I&#39;m ELATED!!! WIll do the drawing tonight. xoxo 
thanks for watching and commenting Jillian! Give it a second to marinate -- maybe it&#39;s something that needs to grow on you the way any jean trend might! I know I was so scared of skinnies when they came out (gah! my butt!) but obvi, they&#39;re a staple now. 
Shanti! You HAVE to! it actually will slim and elongate! 
love the blazer option and the shoes! I&#39;m short so never thought about wearing a cuffed pant, but will check this out. 
I prefer the old boyfriend jeans 
You&#39;re 5.5? You look way taller, somehow :P I always have had a hard time finding good jeans but going to look after a pair like these!! :) oh and I really want to find a good looking boot cut pants too. Dark denim..awesome! I feel like this new boyfriend jeans are perfect for us that works in the industry. easy and relaxed but at the same time fashionable :) thanks again for a new video and congrats to your engagement darling! :) xx

Thank you FancyFancy! Always love a great DIY project - would love to turn some boxy old denim jeans into slimmer cuts so I have those lazy-day jeans but want a tad better fitting and body-enhancing! 
Hey Kimmy Nice video ! I think I need to go shopping now . Looking for some new boyfriend jeans ! ;) Smooches â¡ 
love the shoes~!!! Nice~ 
That blazer is GORG 
I wear old boyfriend jeans. But on my SUPER lazy days. By the way for people with sewing skills and want to try tailoring their old boyfriend jeans, a youtuber named withwendy has a great series on tailoring denim. 
LOVE IT.. I loved ALL of the outfits, seriously! That b 
i got so excited when i saw this in my subscriptions! love these kimmy! 
The final look was my fave! Yay! Missed your videos, so helpful! 
looks fantastic! 
These are really great looks! Any ideas on how to get these cheap? I want a pair cause they look so comfy 
i loved the blazer look because of the attention you gave to the bottom really totally awesome taste and choice... ontop of the necklace elegant blazr touch and white cas top 
they are the BEST! I take them to every fitting, and every client LOVES. They&#39;re called the MARKER and if you order online, buy a size down. They&#39;re on zappos. xoxo 
The new format has arrived! Watch my latest WHAT TO WEAR Â discussing the NEW boyfriend jean and tell me what you think!Â ?

thank youuuuu!! will include more going forward! 
love you alana!!!! miss you like nuts.... 
Glad you&#39;re back, girl! &lt;3 
This video was awesome! I loved that you include prices so I know what to expect. loved it!! p.s. i loved the fast forward parts 
I had no idea about curved jeans! You&#39;re so full of knowledge! 
What!!! I love graphic tees!!? 
When it comes to that hair... &quot;less is more&quot; -_-? 
&quot;Get over yourself! I&#39;m not following you! If we happen to be going the same way, it&#39;s because maybe we want the same food.&quot;<br /><br />I truly love Allison... She&#39;s my favorite.? 
Every time there&#39;s a buzzfeed video with Jen I freak out a little bit when I see her...SHES SO PRETTY OMG? 
Maybe BuzzFeed should start a graphic Tshirt line. I&#39;d but that? 
Band tees are the way to go. I think graphic tees with print on them are cool as well; but at the end of the day I always grab a super big band tee or something with a pop culture reference on it. None of this I&#39;m a cat stuff. lol (although cats are cool)? 
I have a craphic t-shirt from Zara. On the t-shirt it says &quot;confidence is the best outfit&quot;.<br />I think that is true!? 
&quot;I have nothing important to say.&quot; I want that shirt? 
These are all horrible and all the reactions are hilarious, especially &quot;my house has better water pressure than yours&quot; XD LMAO? 
The girl talking at <a sounds like Alexis g zall omg ? 
You think those don&#39;t make sense ? You should see the graphic t-shirts that are a new trend in Japan. And a bit in South Korea too. ðððð? 
&quot;Is this a reference to cat-calling? Because then I might like it.&quot;<br /><br />No.. not everything is about misogyny.? 
Stop following me is in a cirle so you can&#39;t stop following? 
I have the yes I&#39;m an actual cat shirt? 
If I was a girl I would wear the cat tee :3? 
all i could think of were the Â penny tshirts from icarly with random things written on them .lol? 
How about reviewing T-shirts with Japanese, Korean, Chinese, French, and any other language with people who actually speak and read the language? I know a lot of shirts that mesh together random Japanese and Chinese characters together so that it looks &quot;aesthetic&quot; and &quot;cool&quot;. It&#39;s not just the Asian languages, there&#39;s been plenty of languages where the words are put on shirts without a care of grammar or what the words even mean.? 
They picked like the most stupid graphic t-shirts they could find i think? 
hahahaha allison&#39;s disappointment at gabby Â for approving of the second shirt is amazing!!!? 
sad to see that gabby doesn&#39;t like t swizz :(? 
Ashly is on point. <br />&quot;There was something else going on there&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yea , drugs&quot;? 
Gabby&#39;s BFF is kind of a Pandora&#39;s box isn&#39;t she? OPEN IT!? 
btw teenagers arnt huge fans of them either? 
IM ASHAMED TO BE A TEENGER? 
I like that girl&#39;s Pembroke Corgi shirt.? 
The girl in the green hoodie has beautiful eyes? 
<a The brunette loks like the girl from 50 Shades of Grey.? 
Okay but look at alanis morissette...much more creative when single and angry. Also taylor swift&#39;s best songs are her breakup songs. Falling in love may kill creativity...but falling out of love sparks it. It&#39;s a long shot lol. Benefit of the doubt. ? 
The &quot;my commute is better than yours &quot; shirt was hilarious. I would wear it. Some people don&#39;t understand irony ? 
Make more of these videos please!!!!? 
i saw this cute t-shirt that said something like &quot;stay weird&quot; on it, except it was on one line at the top and was upside down...and i was like, I NEED THAT? 
i just got the cat meaning! some stupid guy can call a hot girl a cat! so yeah that&#39;s what its for! now that i know what the meaning is well... what &quot;i think the meaning is&quot; i quite like that shirt!? 
error #404 cool t-shirt not found. that is something that they need to put on a t-shirt. except I am going to do it first.? 
XD My favorite graphic tee i found said &quot;my day was going great until, People&quot;? 
My fav shirt with a writing on it is <br />If you don&#39;t like my opinion of you <br />You can always improve <br />XD? 
Those shirts make sense to me. And I&#39;m pretty sure i&#39;m older than most of the people at Buzzfeed.? 
i do like a lot of Forever 21&#39;s clothes and i shop there all the time, but a lot of the time I do see a really cute t shirt then they ruin it by putting something stupid like &quot;better than you&quot; (or something dumb and narsasistic that i cant think about atm) that if i wore it would probably be ironically? 
That&#39;s why everybody else loves Hot Topic? 
those literally make no sense but i would actually wear the fricking cat shirt because i think it&#39;s cute okay? 
im sure that many of you out there know this, but for all you lovely ladies (and dudebros) out there that like graphic tees, but not stuff like this, try websites like snorg tees, busted tees, and my personal favorite: tee public? 
&quot;I have nothing important to say&quot; is actually very usefull to have on your tee tho. I like this one.? 
I thought the cat shirt was dumb until the girl said that it was dealing with cat calling.? 
I feel like if someone is following you then you should report that and be worried, you shouldn&#39;t make a shirt about it...? 
Put on that &quot;stop following me&quot; t-shirt &amp; I promise you&#39;ll never take it off. Most comfy shirt EVER.? 
Where can I get that Corgi t-shirt??? :D? 
allison is so funny and relatable. im obsessed? 
Omg i just realised i have the same dress that Gaby&#39;s wearing, lmao? 
Wat does commute mean? 
If you want a good graphic tee go to RAD. Some are really nice.? 
A tee with &#39;I have nothing to say&#39; on it does already exist lol ð? 
I want that cat shirt okay-? 
I&#39;m a teenager and I don&#39;t even understand these shirts? 
Fuckin dykes? 
Guys... what if<br />&quot;My commute is better than yours&quot; is like:<br />Commute = travel, to go, adventure, or TRIP<br />You know like, omg this drug gave me a hell of a trip. I&#39;m &quot;tripping&quot; <br />So BASICALLY:<br />&quot;My TRIP is better than yours&quot; cause my drugs are better ððð<br /><br />....no? Too much? Reading TOO into it? Ok (\(._.)/) ma&#39; bad...? 
I would just want the cat shirt because of pet play &lt;3? 
I saw that commute shirt at the mall a couple of days ago and my friend and I spent a good 5 minutes mocking it.? 
the &quot;falling in love kills creativity&quot; one looked like it could be on a tumblr aesthetic blog tbh? 
All these butthurt teenage girls are commenting &quot;she said teens scare her?!?!11? omg so rude!1!!!1! nobody understands teens ugh!&quot;<br />So now I&#39;m laughing not only because of the commentary in the video but also at them.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I&#39;m dying. XD? 
I have the &quot;Yes, I&#39;m an actual cat&quot; shirt lmao? 
The commute one is actually amusing.? 
I MUST know where that corgi running shirt that girl is wearing is from!? 
Gabby seriously bothers me. Like I&#39;m not trying to be critical or anything, she just really gets on my nerves. ? 
The girl with the bangs looks like the girl from 50 shades of grey? 
Did she say Taylor Swift kills creativity? I respect Gabby a lot but I have to strongly disagree with her on that.? 
The background musicÂ is so weird? 
Stop following me shirt seems like a celebrities = paparazzi type of thing.<br /> ..which we all know celebrities are followed everyday by them so makes sense for them to wear it...right? ? 
Ashley &quot;Yeah, like drugs&quot;? 
Hipsters ReviewÂ Â Forever 21 Graphic Tees? 
I&#39;m a teenager. I wear NONE of these.? 
This is why I hate Forever 21. It&#39;s so fucking lame.? 
I&#39;m in love with the lady in the maroon shirt im actually in love? 
I have the cat shirt...? 
Where can you buy those caps like Jen is wearing? With the Trending sign on it. I&#39;ve seen variations of it in other videos and I&#39;m really curious...? 
oh my god the girl with the blond hair and glasses is the most annoying<br /><br />she has the feel of a person with a tumblr account lmfao? 
I like graphic tees. I&#39;m wearing Gravity Falls one right now! They&#39;re like advertisements of you personality and interests. And sometimes they work! I wore a My Chemical Romance Black Parade tee to school and got compliments from people I didn&#39;t know were fans!? 
I totally get the shirt that says &#39;Falling in love kills creativity&#39;. Let me break it down for ya! While your single and sitting by yourself you picture all these cute scenarios relating to love and relationships(using your imagination). But then, when you actually fall in love, you realize all the stuff you imagined will never actually happen, therefore killing your creativity. I&#39;m not sure tho... Whoa did I just write this? Dayum girl!? 
Maybe the shirts are sarcastic? 
make another? 
I need the cat one!!!!? 
2 of my cousins bashed on me because they always shop at Forever 21 and they wear those stupid tees, and I looked at one of them one day and I said that the writing on her t-shirt sounded like a drug reference and they both got so butt hurt XD? 
I WANT THE CAT ONE? 
how do you follow some one from the front?? 
&quot;if I happen to be going the same way is probably because we want the same food&quot; xD? 
I would wear every one except the cat one. Not sorry. I&#39;m an asshole. I deserve these T-shirts.? 
the mens clothes at forever 21 sucks they look flamboyant as hell? 
I understood all of them. The first one was because you want to do everything that your lover want you to do and wear so you aren&#39;t being really expressing yourself yet the other persons interest. The second one was like that because cats sometime aren&#39;t a big fans of people. I have three cats myself and a lot of the time they don&#39;t want me petting or playing with them. Saying ur an actual cat means you want them to leave you alone But since cats are cute It&#39;s like Yeah, I get it I&#39;m cute stop flirting leave me alone. There is a deeper meaning to Everyone people.? 
&quot;If someone&#39;s following you need to not wear a t shirt&quot; great advise 101? 
I&#39;m wonderingâ¦if only 3% of the population is supposed to be gayâ¦.then why are at least 50% of Buzz Feed&#39;s peeps gay?? 
I have a t-shirt that says &quot;HAHA you got burned!&quot; And there are two pieces of toast and one is sad and burnt. ? 
I have the shirt from <a ...? 
On the shirt that said &quot;Stop following me&quot; the words also happened to be arched like a rainbow . my first thought was &quot;follow the rainbow&quot;. Could&#39;ve been a pun? 
I would brag about good water pressure? 
with the cat shirt it should have said &quot; yes, I&#39;m an actual cat, meow please go away&quot; in stead of &quot; yes,I&#39;m an actual cat , meow, now please go away&quot; it makes more sense ? 
isnt the stop following me quote from finding nemo?? 
I saw a shirt in Forever 21 that said &quot;Less Selfies, More Books&quot; and physically had to restrain myself I was so livid. Yeah shame self confidence and fan the flame of the stereotypical &quot;attractive nerdy girl&quot; trope will you. I love reading immensely, but I just find that offensive and extremely contributory to an unhealthy superiority complex the world has so recently got a hard-on for.? 
I saw the title to this and I immediately looked at my fucking &quot;meow I&#39;m an actual cat&quot; crop top and regret every choice I&#39;ve ever made. ? 
Forever 21 Thread Screen: Behind the Scenes - // <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" 
Kinda cool, but kinda lame at the same time.? 
Great Idea! Impossible :)<br />I Invite You to Watch My Channel? 
When you put your time into making a useless screen and not into figuring out how to make a god damn shirt that doesn&#39;t rip after 2 wears, you know you fucked up.? 
This is incredible. The team work, the design, the genius that went into this is mind boggling. <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag"

Neat marketing project and a very creative idea. Thanks for sharing.? 
Damn it theres six hundred and sixty six likes on this :o? 
But what will it be used for? ? 
but why?? 
The men&#39;s section for this place is not even slightly appealing.? 
It doesn&#39;t get much hipster than this.? 
The screen will last only slightly longer than their blouses.? 
why the fuck would anyone want this.. or even consider buying this...? 
Oh wow this is fascinating!!? 
Lol why don&#39;t you use all that thread to make clothes that lasts more than 6 months ?

who ever is watching in 2015 like xD? 
i liked the romeo and juliet reference at the start hahaha? 
How did i come here from videos of drunks getting beaten up?<br />YouTube ... you did it again.? 
I work at a Forever21 in Canada and yes we have policies we have to follow like one person per cabin but the way they treated you is ridiculous. The second they noticed your mother was in the cabin with you they simply ask politely if she can exit, i know at the store i work at we would have never yelled or slammed on the door like you described. i&#39;m not telling you this is to get some sort of justification for Forever21 i&#39;m telling you this because i&#39;m 100% surprised by your Forever21&#39;s actions. I feel like actions need to be taken and if that&#39;s by emailing managers or district managers then i think that&#39;s what should happen, i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just those few workers but it saddens me to know that people such as yourself have been treated so unfairly in stores because sometimes us workers aren&#39;t treated fairly... As an employee of Forever21 we are constantly reminded that we should be giving the customer the best experience we can, these workers should know better and don&#39;t worry karma will get them!? 
I don&#39;t shop at forever 21 anymore ? 
Also they let me and about 3 other friends in one dressing room and didn&#39;t say anything about it ? 
When I had went to the one in Baltimore they were completely nice and all of the dressing rooms were open sorry you had a bad experience ? 
At forever21 I got yelled at because I wanted a dress and the person wouldn&#39;t let me get it because it didn&#39;t look good on me I still got it but we had some words. ? 
I went to Forever 21 a few weeks ago and I had never been to one before. I saw the jeans were under 10$ so I went over to the rack IÂ saw that the sizes where strangeÂ then a employee came up to me and asked if I need help. Now this lady was kind ofÂ meanÂ toÂ me she looked at me up and down and gave me a dirty look. I told her if I where a size 3/5 inÂ jeans what would I be in there jeans? she toldÂ a size 3 would be a 27 but that IÂ /need/ a bigger size. like what?! I mean come onÂ you don&#39;t tell someone that they may want to try on a bigger sizeÂ like that.Â I went to try on the jeans and to beÂ honest the 27 was to big and I need to get a size smaller. this lady made me so mad I will never shop there aging at lest not in store? 
I&#39;ve never been to forever21. Probably bc I&#39;m fatter than a cow and most retail stuff doesn&#39;t fit me. I just scrolled through the comments. Amazed at how many ppl had bad experiences. Totally jilted and disappointed. ? 
I haven&#39;t really had a problem at forever 21, but I did have a problem with another big popular company, Starbucks. So anyways I go into Starbucks, as I do every morning b4 school and I wait in line and I order an Iced White Mocha latte no whip, which I very clearly told the lady. So I get my order and what does it have on it? Whip cream so I call the lady and I tell her, very politely &quot;I ordered this with no whip.&quot; she rolled her eyes and made like a really nasty faced and to add she kind of snatched it from me and when she gave it back to, she did it in an aggressive sort of manner, no &quot;sorry&quot; or anything. I know it&#39;s not that bad but I&#39;d had long day the day before and that kind of ruined my whole morning.? 
yup forever21 sucks !!!!? 
I live in Ann Arbor MI and the Forever 21 is amazing, I wanted a dress that I saw I few days before and the lady was so helpful!!!! ? 
MOVIES!! of course! i would love to see a &quot;movie club&quot; on ur channel. I don&#39;t think you could find that idea anywhere else. (i may be wrong) &lt;3 you!? 
In my local F21 they have always been rude and snobby. Last time I went 2.5yrs ago (im 5&#39;11.5 and pretty much all legs) I was looking at their pants and one of the workers came up to me and told me their jeans wouldn&#39;t fit me because my legs too &quot;FREAKISHLY LONG&quot; And then proceeded to tell me to go to the plus section.. I had never shopped for pants there until that day so I still have no idea what size I would have worn..I just left. At this time I wore like an American eagle size 6 long pants so its not like I was plus sized then. Not that there is anything wrong with plus size, I am + now,but not back then. I&#39;ve also gotten rude comments from them about my height and weight before. Needless to say I won&#39;t ever go back there. ? 
i can never keep my eyes of her eyes when im watching her videos!! her eyes are the most beautiful blue color i have ever seen on someone in my life!!? 
Forever 21 is so transphobic.<br /><br />I&#39;m not even transexual but i wear guy clothes and girl clothes because idc about gender roles.<br />I was looking at men&#39;s clothes there and an employee said &quot;excuse me, the women&#39;s clothes are over tere, hun.&quot;<br /><br />??? I said &quot;ok?&quot;? 
Forever 21 has 3rd world problems too.? 
Pretty sure you exaggerated the story a bit too much. Just saying.? 
I hate rude employees! Iâve worked in retail for 10 years (various stores) and I cannot imagine being that awful to a customer. It makes my blood boil when I go to a store and I get disrespected by some punk teenager or grumpy middle aged person who hates their life and takes it out on everyone around them.? 
One time I went to Forever 21 they had a ton of clothes in the dressing room just there in huge piles and they had a ton of boxes just sitting around the store it was really messy I guess that don&#39;t really care about what the store looks like if they know people will still shop there no matter what...? 
more videos like this ï¿½?? 
i have never.... EVER in my life been in a store that wouldn&#39;t let me take my mom into the dressing room. its such a common thing. i also have very high anxiety so i would probably have a panic attack..... ughhh im sorry that happened to u.. I ALSO THINK IVE SEEN U AT JOANNS WHEN I WORKED AT THAT GOD AWFUL PLACE :D? 
The Forever 21&#39;s where I go, the employee&#39;s don&#39;t even acknowledge you. You don&#39;t feel welcomed at all, they&#39;re all laughing and talking and it just kinda intimidates me to even go ask for help. I don&#39;t know but definitely dont let some douchebags stop you from getting cute, inexpensive clothes! :)))? 
You didn&#39;t deserve that. What they did was wrong. If that happened to me I probably would have reacted the same way.? 
i hate getting yelled at, too. makes me cringe.? 
yeah i went there for Â my birthday and everyone was rude to me and my friends? 
I always have bad experiences at Forever 21. The one that I go to goes through employees LIKE CRAZY! Every time I go there it&#39;s a completely new team. (And yes, I do go there that often to know all their team members). They did hire this new girl that&#39;s a Miley Cyrus wannabe who&#39;s super fake, but at least she&#39;s trying to be nice, and she is really helpful and she&#39;s the saving grace for their location. If she get&#39;s fired I&#39;m finding a different one to go to.? 
I&#39;ve stopped shopping there about a year ago which really sucked because they are one of the few stores that have nice larger sized clothing at cheap prices? 
I know this was 3 years ago, but I just saw this video.<br />So they told you, only one person per dressing room, you invited your mom in again anyway, and now your upset??? I dont get it. (Respectfully said). WOW YOU GET MASSIVE VIEWS. KUDOS! :-)? 
no but srsly I would go ape shut? 
is it kinda crazy I want something like this to happen to me so I can like show them who&#39;s the customer and work my sass lol? 
omg love the lavender dress? 
This video makes me so mad! It makes me so mad to see you this upset!? 
so i was at a forever 21 near my house in a mall and my mom told me to take my 4 year old sister with me while she ran to go do something in the store right next door. so i grabbed this shirt and went to go try it on and i had to bring in my little sister and they wouldn&#39;t let her in with me so they took her out and i didnt even try on the shirt i just went in the room for 30 seconds and the 2 workers werent even watching her they were talking about someone else and my little sister was on the other side of the store and no one was even watching her. i will never be shopping at another forever 21 EVER again.? 
Omg bunny! Come to North Carolina, forever 21 is great here. Everyone that works there is so cool and they talk to you :-)? 
For anyone that goes through this and management isn&#39;t helpful -ask the manager for their district managers contact info. That&#39;ll make them nervous for sure. Contact the company, they will get in trouble if it&#39;s a good company at all.? 
Bunny, You SHOULDN&#39;T need to be treated like that!!! I could see you almost start to cry in that video. If I where you I would walk down to that same store and talk to her boss or however was in charge of this mean girl that made you feel so frustrated that you cried. I am here for you Bunny. <br />Your fan<br />Kiana ( key-on-ah ) ? 
i love her blue eyes? 
she looks sooooooooooooo pretty in this video like if you agree? 
I&#39;m so sorry? 
Well if u were a kids and ur mom could come in than it shouldn&#39;t matter how old u r. So I think that&#39;s bullcrap. In my opinion cause I like my mom in the room.? 
First, it&#39;s not ok that they yelled at you, took a snotty attitude, or were being physically aggressive by banging like that on the door. But as someone who used to work at F21 I can understand why this happened. It&#39;s a theft prevention issue. You have no idea how many girl/women/family/bestie duos would go into a dressing room together and then I&#39;d go and clean up the room after and find all sorts of censors they had pried off. When you tell a customer one per room and then they immediately go and do it again you start thinking something shady must be up. They handled the situation badly, but if you&#39;re wondering, there&#39;s a bit of explanation behind it. :/? 
I always shop F21 online because I know my size at that store but I have gone to the store a few times and didn&#39;t have terrible experiences except that the stores always seem to be super cluttered but customer service seems fine. One time I was asking a lady employee what size leggings I should get or something and I said I was plus size and she said I didn&#39;t look plus size so that was cool (and I&#39;m obviously THICK) so that was nice of her. Idk, I haven&#39;t had bad experiences besides the basic leggings always being sold out online. The stores I&#39;ve been to are in Florida btw maybe people are just nicer here or something.? 
You can shop at H&amp;M if you&#39;re going to boycott forever 21 :) H&amp;M (in my opinion) has roughly the same, if not better products :)? 
They&#39;ve always been snobs to me too. Not all of the people there are totally horrid but a lot are like, high school click stupid.? 
The glasses remind me of willy wonka? 
Oh my gosh! I thought I was the only one.<br />I went to the store with my best friend like I always used to and she was trying on clothes in a dressing room and I was trying on clothes in the next one and so we both came out and were like, &quot;do you think I could wear this?&quot; And then this one guy just came out of nowhere and was all like, &quot;you can&#39;t wear the clothes out of the dressing rooms and I almost punched him in the face because I was so mad. It drove me crazy that he would do that when he knew what we were doing. <br />I&#39;m glad that I wasn&#39;t the only one that has had a bad experience like that. Sorry for such a long comment but I just wanted to tell you? 
I don&#39;t know what to say about this. I fell like rest of the world has more important problems, then some rude person at some store and this is not a good reason to cry. I think you just waste your tears out of not such a big deal.? 
She looks SOOO pretty in this video. Not that she&#39;s not pretty. But she looks like a princess? 
Hey she needs to be respected and what they did was rude and if you don&#39;t have anything nice to say then stop watching her and stop commenting? 
you look so pretty in this video love the lipstick color what is it called? 
That happened to me I always go into dressing rooms with my mom so she can see the clothes that I&#39;m trying on and they wouldn&#39;t let us in one together and told us one per room and I got really mad and didn&#39;t feel that good like you and I do not shop there anymore.? 
I know this video is super old but I decided to tell you my experience in forever 21:/ So I was shopping with my sister and we went to a fitting room because she wanted to show me how the clothes looked. We were walking into the same dressing room when I saw 2 employees (they were girs who looked like they were in their early 20s) and I saw them kind of snickering and pointing at us but I just thought nothing of it and kept walking into the dressing room. One of the employees comes up to me and says &quot;Only one per dressing room&quot; (that wasn&#39;t a rule before). My sister says to just wait outside of the room and she&#39;ll come out and show it to me. So I&#39;m just standing there waiting when I hear them laughing and pointing again. This time I ask her &quot;Is there something you would like to tell me?&quot; And she says &quot;Well it&#39;s just that you&#39;re just standing there in the middle of the dressing rooms&quot; So I say &quot;I&#39;m waiting for my sister to show me her clothes, she&#39;s in that dressing room&quot; The employee responds &quot;Yes I understand but we have other shoppers and you just standing there is wasting space&quot; So at this point I&#39;m mad and I tell her &quot;Well, you breathing is wasting oxygen&quot; She gets mad, calls the manager and security, my sister gets involved and then we were thrown out of the store. Never went back there again.? 
She was acting so different..she must of really had a bad day..:-/ but she looks sooo beautiful!? 
Why I order online....? 
I&#39;ve actually always hated forever 21! The people there were always rude!! ð£ð£ð£ð£ð¡ð¡ð¡ð I just wanted to punch them? 
Idk if u still read these but if u do if heres what my mom would do. If I was there doing that like trying stuff on and they came pounding on the door 2 times she would have lashed ou and we would have been thrown out? 
if anyone had E V E R yelled at my M O T H E RÂ  I would have come UNGLUED!!! I have a terrible loyalty thing and I would have been DOWN that GIRLS throat!! NOBODY yells at MY MOM!!!Â  That is so awful and embarrassing!! It was a big deal and unnecessary!? 
whenever I watch her videos I get mesmerized and distracted by the blueness of her eyes for a sec! &gt;&lt;? 
I will never shop in Forever 21 after hearing this.? 
I would have had to resist the urge to just knock her and the managers heads together? 
Oh god Noone CARES? 
Define &#39;first world problems&#39;.... ? 
hello~i think you are so cool~i love your style~i also want to share my clothes with you too~i was so in love with forever 21, lets share our feeling about forever 21!!!? 
I went to forever 21 for a friend&#39;s present and I saw a nirvana shirt (not in my size). THEN A DITSY BLONDE GIRL WALKED UP TO IT AND SAID, âOOO I LOVE THE NIRVANA BRAND!!!1!1!ï¿½? TO HER FRIEND. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t shop there anymore, it&#39;s filled with idiots. ? 
I never had any problems at forever 21 I just walked around ? 
It&#39;s been quite a long time since I shopped in store. I found Vinted and Poshmark and love getting things there for next to nothing.? 
&quot;It&#39;s that kind of mad where you just want to cry and spray silly string in someone&#39;s face&quot;.. I literally just fell on the floor haha you&#39;re great!? 
I love that Alligators made it :P Omg that should be a new brand.? 
My mom and I do the same thing! And someone did that to us to my mom got mad and came in after they lady went off somewhere else and then we left quickly after that.. Honestly why do people have to be rude like what happened to being polite in public sorry that happened..? 
i &lt;3 the clothes? 
they suck? 
I tried to get a crop top at forever 21 ,the zipper broke and they said it was my fault and that i was &quot;too round&quot;. i went home and cryed for 2 days? 
i have my mom in the dressing room, my mom freaking has me in the dressing room! Bunny, i understand. People can be terrible.? 
Im to skinny for there cloths? 
Ive been personally victimized be forever 21 ? 
It hasn&#39;t happened to me, but my friend ((who is a little over-weight)) was looking for some cute clothes and asked if they had this piece of clothing in her size ((which isn&#39;t very big, mind you)). She was told by the employee that Forever 21 &quot;doesn&#39;t have clothes for fat people.&quot; Needless to say, we don&#39;t shop there anymore.? 
3+ years later...I hope you emailed them... if they&#39;re like the company I work for it&#39;s a huge deal...it goes through regional and district before hitting the store so a lot of people see the complaint if it&#39;s a bad one...and it sounds like you have a real doozy to report.<br />PS.<br />MOVIES<br />BOOKS<br />thanks! :D? 
She sounds so different back then ? 
I don&#39;t like being yelled at either. and whenever my mom and I go to a store, I have to go in the dressing room with her, usually she comes in with me but sometimes she doesn&#39;t because she just doesn&#39;t feel like it? 
that&#39;s my H&amp;M? 
Hey Bunny, did you ever write to corporate about your bad experience at forever 21; about the two employees and manager? just a curious question. Also I&#39;ve just found out about you and I think your pretty cool!!^^ keep it up! Stay happy and positive!!!? 
Next time you go there just pretend you&#39;re looking at stuff and fling it on the floor lol repeat until everything is on the floor? 
I&#39;m exactly like you bunny , me and my friends always hang out there personally, I&#39;ve never had a bad experience in Forever21. Maybe because I live in Dallas. The forever21 I shop at is one floor but is spread out in 6 sections , they usually have 18 dressing rooms open. A store that is 2 stories should atleast have more than 5 opened ? 
This honestly makes me so furious. HOW can employees treat customers like that?. If I were you i swear to god I would punch every single one of them in the face. And I know you don&#39;t like to be loud or cause a scene, but I swear to you, I would start screaming at them about how they treated you. They are complete assholes. I am shaking so badly it annoys me that much? 
Wow they were very rude. You should have contacted the District Manager.? 
Appearances, personal fashion and clothes are supposed to be one way of making you feel comfortable and express and be confident about yourself. I have never felt any more conscious (and sometimes even ASHAMED omg) of what I wore, or the way I pulled down a hanger, or looked at a mirror, or walked into the dressing room, than I ever have at our F21 branch.<br />I&#39;m sure not ALL branches are like this... I&#39;m praying, actually. Since it&#39;s a really widespread and popular brand, you&#39;d think the customer service would be more professional and well rehearsed. I had more of the staring and sniggering and the (god forbid other branches have this) eye-rolling.? 
It seems like a lot of the rules shops enact to help prevent theft also end up running off good customers. The teen/twenty something&#39;s they hire to staff their shops are not trained in tact, or diplomacy so they tend towards immature and legalistic. If you have a bad customer experience with a store, go over their heads. Corporate offices often do not want clients run off by rudeness. There ARE better ways to tell people, why they cannot do something in a shop.<br />Also keep in mind that these shop&#39;s staff and in-store management tend to be rather dramatic and clique-ish. So they don&#39;t de-escalate the situation if there is conflict. If anything they tend to ramp it up to make YOU the consumer...the villain. Worst case scenario, never return to the store and let corporate know you&#39;re not going back. Plus, putting out this video will also help. Negative word of mouth goes faaaarrr further than even good.? 
I had an employ Â ask me to leave because I didn&#39;t look like I could afford anything in there, (which is true), but she didn&#39;t have the right to ask me that. Me and my friends just wanted to have fun.? 
If I have ever had the same experience as you did I would have said I&#39;m just telling my mom if she likes it! And I would have kick her ass and I&#39;m a girl btw? 
Forever 21...human cruelty from the sweat shops to the cash register. That store is crooked. Can&#39;t wait for them to shut down.? 
She is talking as fast as i do <b>-</b> omg i am not the only one? 
This whole video was out of focus ? 
Can you stop touching your hair please it irks me.? 
I really like all your videos I just wish you wouldn&#39;t talk so fast. haha breathe in-between sentences.? 
where are those leggings from?! anybody know?? 
Is it just me or is she so annoying to the point of wanting to pull your hair out? Also great intro it was half the freaking video and stop touching your hair....? 
where did you buy the agenda / planner on the left??? 
Do a night time routine!!!? 
Your body is so fabulous ? 
You talk too fast. I have no idea what are you saying most of the video?

Talked to much about nothing I cared about in the video. I clicked on it for a haul and you were talking about a stupid app. Stick to the topic? 
she is extremely annoying and talk way too much? 
She talks super fast and rambles ? 
Girl just slow down a little when talking. You were making me anxious through out this whole haul ! Not being rude at all, just giving constructive criticism. You make great videos but when you talk soo quickly it&#39;s hard to pay attention. I couldn&#39;t even finish the video tbh ? 
holy. could you talk any faster..? 
she reminds me so much of holland roden, or lydia from teen wolf, they&#39;re both crazy beautiful ? 
You look like Juliette Lewis! ? 
Good video, but you talk so fast I can&#39;t understand a word you are saying. ? 
I dont buy at Forever21 because SALVES work for them!! <br />The clothes are amazing but I dont support slavery and thats how they manage to have such small prices and lots of stuff ? 
Jesus Christ what are you saying <br />?

You remind me of suede ð I love both of you? 
Those glasses look amazing on you!!!? 
Girl, I enjoyed the haul and video. But, PLEASE slow down and take a breath it was really hard to keep up with what you were saying. Also your hair is fine, please quit touching it a lot. It is really distracting.? 
This girl is really into herself ?

really loving your hair ï¿½? darker hair looks so pretty on you? 
She&#39;s so cute, until she opens her mouth and talks so fast and no one understands.. And when she always flips her hair (annoying) or saying &quot;like&quot; too much, but other than that cute clothes girl? 
Lol please talk a littttleee bit slower ðð§ð? 
Vokabulary: like, literally, so, cute.<br />The end.?

And kudos to your Hubby for loving you just the way you are as well! I have a boyfriend who is just as positive and self affirming, its the best feeling. Keep up the good work and keep loving your life! Cheers!? 
her body is so cute omf? 
So inspiring!ð I wish I had this much self confidenceððð­? 
You hair and makeup makes you resemble Carrie Underwood in this video :-)? 
Omg I am so glad I found this channel. You r an inspiration to me and ur sooo confident. I really want to wear a bikini but I always thought I was too big but u have made me realize that I can wear what ever I want n that I shouldn&#39;t judge myself by what other people think of me. I cannot thank u enough. @LoeyLane? 
I wish I was as confident as you on my weight ily ð? 
I just started watching ur videos and so far love it am big girl and u have more confidence then me am so shy to even show so much skin but now idk maybe I will show more thumbs up ... Plus am going start doing You tube videos coming soonï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?? 
You are so beautiful ð Role model ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½? I love you soooo much ð? 
Great pieces, I wish they were more realistically styled on the websites, as I don&#39;t often like the combos. Â Additionally, I hate that Plus sized is only really online, and it&#39;s such a hassle to return/ exchange. Â I wish they had like a stand alone boutique or a larger section in general.? 
Forever 21 is known for rip offs like that. Their return policy sucks too.? 
This girl is inspiration. Every since I was little, I&#39;ve had confidence issues and I thought I wasn&#39;t beautiful like other girls, or no guy would ever like me. She is extremely gorgeous and beautiful, she&#39;s so confident in who she is it makes me think, &quot;I&#39;m beautiful the way I am, I can be confident in my weight.&quot; She is awesome and I got she never stops doing what she&#39;s doing. <br />Love you &lt;3? 
Could you do a fitness routine?? 
hey loey make makeup videos? 
You are so pretty ððâºï¿½?âºï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ðï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ðï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ðï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?? 
I&#39;m actually obsessed with you<br />you&#39;re absolutely adorable<br />xx?

Just leave her alone. Everyone with your shitty mean and rude comments. You have nothing better to do with your lives than bash on this gorgeous woman? Wtf is wrong with society. She is perfectly healthy and happy in her life so just get over yourselves. No one cares what you all think.? 
ððð i love you. ? 
You are suchh goals ^-^ &lt;3? 
Your not fat your curvy should be proud to beðððð ? 
I&#39;d fuck her? 
So glad I found your channel, you&#39;ve giving me so much confidence! :) ? 
This is the second video of your channel that I&#39;m watching an I am so amazed by your clothing style! You&#39;re doing a great job and do net let anybody tell you someting else! You have one of the most beautiful faces I have ever seen on Youtube!? 
I&#39;ve recently got into skirts and when I wear them I always wear a long cardigan because I have to wear the skirt lower on my butt ? 
She is so sexy she should use it? 
Thanks for this video! You inspired me to dress the clothes that i want even im a bit fat. I now realize that if a plus size gal like you - with those bulges and fat layers - i can also wear tight fitting clothes.? 
Im from Kansas too!!? 
I was surprised about how &quot;Big&quot; you were! By your face i thought that you were skinny! But you are still really pretty. &lt;3? 
Been watching your vids all night. You are my new inspiration. Thank you !!? 
I love your confidence and wish I had the confidence to wear these things!<br />You have great style also.? 
love the bathing suits? 
Wow i absolutely adore your makeup in this vid&lt;3 right up my alley!? 
i love the first dress on you? 
I love her hair.? 
I just found your videos today. and omg I love your videos. Please keep up the good work. I recently gained 50lbs due to depression. And Ive been having a really hard time seeing myself as beautiful and sexy. And seeing how confident you are and how good you look. It has given me a whole new look on myself. Thank you so much. ^.^? 
Have you ever tried Sonoma Intimates? they have a great collection for beautiful voluptuous women!? 
I forgot to mention that you definitely should be a model. I can&#39;t believe how beautiful you are you definitely should model, someone needs to see these videos and pick you up as a model. Thanks again for all your awesome videos, keep making them.? 
Just came across your video I just wanted to say you are absolutely beautiful and I love your attitude. You have a very healthy psyche and I&#39;m so glad you made these videos. I feel like there&#39;s an attack on the American woman that no matter what she does she&#39;s never good enough tall enough skinny and curvy enough she has straight hair its bad she has curly hair it&#39;s bad I&#39;m just so sick of it all this BS. This is the most awesome video I&#39;ve seen in a while on YouTube thank you, thank you, thank you!? 
I hope I can be like you, so confident, someday.? 
Oh my god you look so good! Two last and with &quot;PARIS&quot; clothes and swimsuits suit you so good! love ya? 
you do your make up so nicely omg? 
I so love your Videos.? 
Your so gorgeous!? 
Thanks for sharing your reviews!!! You&#39;e very inspirational and I&#39;m glad to see you have the confidence to share your information. Thanks :-)? 
I love how comfortable and accepting you are of your own body. Very inspiring. You&#39;re very beautiful and a real positive force for women.? 
Your so pretty ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?ï¿½?? 
Did you try rotating your sleeve on the shirt with the lace sleeves? It looks like it Â may have just been twisted weird. It may make all the difference. Â New subscriber by the way! Love your confidence, hopefully I can borrow some. :)? 
I love how confident you are with your body. I&#39;m a teen girl who isn&#39;t the thinnest, and it is such an inspiration to see women who are confident with they&#39;re bodies, especially when being plus size. Thanks for being such an inspiration, it really makes me feel more confident, and realize that I can be confident in my body without being stick thin. Thank you for being you :)? 
You&#39;r si beautiful? 
<span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" oid="118054963575905394842">LoeyLane</a></span> hey Loey Darlin as a plus side teen I&#39;m wondering where you go to buy sizes that fit us big girl? Ik you shop at forever 21+ but where else have our sizes ?? And Not!! Just online I wanna be able to try close on at the store Not! Online if they don&#39;t have our sizes. If u can help I would appreciate it thanks hun ðð? 
The clothes are so pretty and your super pretty :3 ? 
with the sleeve that&#39;s &quot;sewn wrong&quot; you just need to adjust it. twist the sleeve to where the line on the sleeve is in the middle of your arm. Like hold out your arm and pull the sewn line forward and it&#39;ll fix how it bunches up under your underarm (Lol idk how to explain it but I hope this helps if no one has already)? 
I love plus size women. I&#39;m a guy who&#39;s in the gym 4 days a week lifting in great shape. Bigger girls just get me going. I don&#39;t know exactly why but they are hot and I got nothing against thin girls, they turn me on too as long as they still got a nice round ass and big tits. I just find beautiful girls like this one in the video with more cushion for the pushin very sexy. I know I sound kind of rude and crude but I want to be honest. I&#39;m not a bad guy.? 
I&#39;m considered plus size now and you really inspire me to be more confident with my body. Like I&#39;m not even kidding right now, my closet is pretty much leggings and sweaters but I think now that I know that Forever 21&#39;s plus size clothes actually look good on plus size women, I might just have to go shopping. ? 
Omg I love your channel you&#39;re amazing and my new inspirationï¿½?ð you&#39;re also very very beautiful ? 
Loved the white lace crop top. Work it girl!? 
you are so beautiful.? 
Wait, when you&#39;re married do you still have individual money?? 
I loooooooove the tribal swimsuit. It looks awesome on you. ? 
that first gray dress looks gorgeous on you. &lt;3? 
You&#39;re not even fat. You&#39;re curvy, you have a beautiful body to be honest<br /> :3? 
<a You&#39;re supposed to cross the top. Thats how I wear it :)?

im so haopy i found your channel! your awesome beautiful and amazing. i really look up to you!? 
the striped dress &amp; grey crop top w high wasted pants look absolutely stunning on you!!ððð? 
You&#39;re so beautiful! I love all the clothes and bathing suits! Your channel is awesome :)? 
I love your confidence. I&#39;m around 110 pounds and a bit &quot;chubby&quot; because I&#39;m relatively small and I&#39;m not even confident enough to wear dresses that are slightly shorter than knee-lenght. I&#39;m allready working out and do a really healthy diet, but I never really achieve a body shape I&#39;m 100% fine with so I keep dressing conservative and I would never go swimming (as I would not like to only wear a bikini or swim suite).? 
You&#39;re beautiful . I watch these videos to kinda hope some of your confidence rubs on me . You have plenty to share ð? 
you are so pretty and I love how confident you are in your body! ?

U are very pretty? 
I adore your confidence the fact that you can wear a bikini and post it online without being worried about what other people think ( no offence ) but you are on the plus side as am I and I was wondering if I could get some advice on how to be as confident as you and I love your makeup ðï¿½?ð? 
I fell in love with your channel ï¿½?ðð? 
I&#39;m super late but you could have definitely taken it back even though it&#39;s final sale.?

You&#39;re eyebrows are incredible!? 
I&#39;d wear the wifey shirt with a black skater skirt! Everything you got is too adorable, love your videos!!â¥ :)? 
Can I buy like, a lot of clothing with 300$???? 
If your jeans are too baggy and you don&#39;t want to return them, you can always get them tailored. It would be relatively cheap and should solve any oversize issues? 
Why don&#39;t you find a store in which you can take and adjust your clothing?? 
What size is the karma tank ? They only have med left in website and I&#39;m not sure if the sizing runs big or small? âï¿½?ð? 
Hey Kathleen! I&#39;m a new youtuber and I have the same interests as you, and I want to follow in your footsteps!

I miss your try-on hauls!! ?

Outfit suggestions: that grey skirt you can wear with that cute grey Tshirt with the cuffed sleeves and the cute silver choker or that grey toupey top with the cutouts no necklace. That green skirt u can wear with ANY of the green tops u got the strip one or the one with the cuffed sleeves and pair it with the other gold choker you got. Overall great looks!? 
I cannot wait for you to upload a house tour!!? 
We have the same taste in clothes! The cocoon cardigan, metallic lattice top, that gorgeous multilayer necklace and those heels! â¡ Amazing haul! ? 
Yes winter can go away anytime now ! It&#39;s been so cold I can&#39;t take it any more. But on another note that pajama set! Love!!! Even though I&#39;m married . Lol? 
I love watching your clothing haul videos, your style in clothing is so cute! ? 
You are so beautiful and inspirational, and amazing at makeup! I love how you are so real and honest, and I love how you let people know that you have rosacea and aren&#39;t afraid to show it! You&#39;re beautiful inside and out! &lt;3? 
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll read this or not but you&#39;ve been a huge role model for me and a big life changer. I didn&#39;t have a mom growing up to teach me how to be a girl and your videos really help. Thank you so much!! Love you!?

Tutorial on this make up look please !ï¿½?? 
Commend yourself for being a great guru who you can tell loves their subscribers just by simply replying to comments, you probably get a lot of comments so I&#39;m sure its hard to get through all but interacting with your viewers like that seems so small of an act but means a lot! Shows you care about the people watching you :) Also you are gorgeous with or without makeup and your soul is beautiful I love watching you. I remember watching you when I didnt even know who you were and it was at your old house in Georgia I think? A long long time ago. And now you&#39;ve grown and you kept being loyal through your journey on Youtube. I&#39;m sure you get this a lot but just know people genuinely adore you :)? 
Loveeeeee your videos ?

Yet you are subscribed to her . . . . ? 
Block me, I don&#39;t give a shit. Not saying I don&#39;t like her, I think she&#39;s gorgeous, and has a great taste in clothing. But, she takes to long to explain one thing and it&#39;s the truth. 
twitter @clothingH 
bitch ass mothercuker 
Ur so pretty 
You take WAY too long to explain one thing. Like seriously, get to the point. My God. 
Are you havr natural blond hair, or like me, natural dark blond highlighted? Anyway, you look sooo pretty :) And I like the way you say k, like realistiK :D 
True religion, all the way! But they do run long, at least on me. 
lol she has an online store that gives her money so she can pay for her stuff, shes not spoiled.. 
Idk why I am this far into your videos, but you have changed soooo much in two years. lol Love you and your videos. Keep it up. XoXoâ¥ 
How old are you? I can&#39;t tell if your a middle schooler or a grown woman. I don&#39;t mean this in a bad way. 
spoiled? She pays for all of her stuff. 
u have really good taste and your so pretty 
Youre a true blonde :) Not many left out there... Anyway, u r sooo pretty :DDDDDDD 
i&#39;m so excited,...a new forever21 store is opening near me :P

sholvo on gmarket is awesome! 
she is literally perfect omg 
Love your style ..wish more girls would dress like you ...I would Definetly date you ..classy and beautiful :) 
i didn&#39;t mean to vote down on ur comment! i meant to vote up! sorry! I agree with u 
Looking back at you older videos... ahh! You were so precious! &lt;3 Not that you aren&#39;t beautiful even today! 
I don&#39;t really like your Tory burch shoes 
can you pleaseeee do a closet tour? please!? you have such amazing style! 
MORE HAULS!! :D CHECK OUT MY BEAUTY AND FASHION CHANNEL!! &lt;3 THANK-YOU! 
i want to buy trues and i think were the same size, what size did you get? 
she actually kind of reminds me of serena van der woodsen too....like a younger version 
@invaderem117 You dont blow that sort of money, you save up for it. =D 
True Religions all the way!!! 
True Religions &gt; Sevens They fit better and are more flattering overall! 
@invaderem117 lol if u know the websites that i do, u could pay about 50 dollars for authentic jeans 
TRUE RELIGIONS ALL THE WAAAY!&lt;3 
@CoralRief43 Have rich parents? 
I love your videos. ppl please subscirbe to my pg. Megan u r my true faviort 
true religions beat sevens by far :D 
You look great 
I want everything in this haul soo badly but I can&#39;t find any of it except the wedges, which unfortunately I cannot afford:( I love your style so much Megan and these colors look beautiful on you 
Ok, so I&#39;m 12. How cam I make money?? 
what bracelets are you wearing??? they are adorable!!! 
Ugh @ some of the comments. Megan makes her own money and she can do whatever she pleases with it!! It&#39;s nice of her to make these hauls, a lot of us love watching them. If it offends you, you don&#39;t have to watch! Just saying! : ) 
@invaderem117 Yeah. Some people are born spoon fed. With the spoon engraved with diamonds in it. 
I swear i watchedd tha whole video, just because you&#39;re HOTTT 
interesting tips 
Did you know that the fur jacket your have that&#39;s really old fashion but it&#39;s pretty 
you r sooo pretty! ! ! 
you&#39;re gorgeous meg :) 
can you do more monthly hauls? :) 
@invaderem117 so why not support the economy? quite frankly, it&#39;s important to keep money circulating. it&#39;s more insulting to people who don&#39;t have money if you have a ton of money and just let it sit there.... just saying. 
@BlueEyedBeautyMakeup bad reason lol 
@doglover51199 Maybe I am to you, or maybe I just don&#39;t want to spend that much money on one pair of clothes I&#39;ll grow out of. I mean if you have the money, go ahead, do whatever you want with it, but everyone you know can spend that? Have you turned on the news lately? Have you seen how many people are without jobs? Some people can barely pay their bills, let alone spend that much on materialistic things. 
FUR IS MURDER! haha jk. i think you should go back to brown hair. it would really bring out your features and youâd a lot moreâ¦ interesting and uniqueâ¦ seriously! 
When you said &quot;Papa don&#39;t peach&quot;, I thought you were about to say &quot;papa don&#39;t pee&quot; hahahahahahaha xD 
@wolreB No, she&#39;s from Texas. 
are you from canada? 
i love your style megannn (: 
Nice vid! I luv true religion jeans!! I have 7 pairs 
Wow i wish i had the money to blow on 200/300$ jeans... Not hatin&#39; just saying 
Why is it anyone&#39;s business where she gets her money from? 
More hauls definitely and i recommend maybe a coach or ugg purse 
@HkHOTgal she gets paid by youtube each month 
@vpinky1 she probably had a coupon or went to an outlet store. 
how did you get the discount of of Ralph lauren? x 
okay so a little late on this comment considering this is a pretty old video but oh my gosh i am just in love with the shirt that you are wearing in this video!! and also i love the sock/boot combo, that is just adorable, so jealousss 
tory burch = &lt;333333

You look great in white! :) 
where do you get your sevens (jeans)?? 
ahh you posted this on my birthday! 
@dangkimberly You remind me of one of those people who are to ignorant to look at the below bar. Doesn&#39;t feel good to be judged, does it? So why would you do it to a 14 year old girl who you know nothing about? Look at her &quot;I&#39;m not perfect&quot; video. Please, just be kinder to people on the internet. ESPECIALLY teenage girls. 
Give me Your Eyes ! â¥ 
@dangkimberly you are very wrong.. 
@dangkimberly how can u say that. go watch watch her my life isn&#39;t perfect video and i think youll change you mind. She is an amazing and blessed girl and she is not spoiled or typical! 
@happydayhoo123 thanks ! (: 
what color are the tory burch shoes? please respond (: i love them! and have a great day. 
I love the top and necklace that you had on cutee

OO nga sis tempting, I am shopping while I am trying to get rid of my clothes at the same time YAY! BAD GIRL ako 
that&#39;s good to know...i&#39;ve been buying on hautelook for 3yrs now,that&#39;s the only time I doubt I could have returned them ,but I forgot to &amp; 14days passes I couldn;t return them anymore. maybe I was tricked by the word VELOUR then when they came they are made with cotton :( 
Great haul hautelook is by nordstrom they don&#39;t sell fake items. Juicy couture uses different fabric a lot especially in different season 
Check out my true religion pick ups? 
My email is !! I love all your clothing hauls!!! If you sell any sz29/30 jeans lmk I will most likely buy them all lol<br />? 
Are you selling any of your larger sized jeans that are to big lol<br />? 
Wow girl....amazing. Dying to see how they look like on so make sure you Insta them! <br />Did I say wow!!!!!!? 
Hi loves! Not sure why the video starts 3 mins. in...but anyways hope you enjoy! Thanks for watching!! Xoxo? 
Whats size are the true religion? 
Wow really nice finds! Plenty of selection, what state are you pickin in? 
Congrats on the boots:) i am getting ready to open up on ebay. Mostly polo shirts. Cant wait and good luck with future sales. 
TRUE RELIGON COST 200 100 AND 300 KEEP THEM IF THERE FAKE OR NOT AWESOME JEANS 
I found a pair of true religion jeans today for $7.99! I&#39;m really happy since it&#39;s only been my second time thrifting. :) 
i have gotten alot of people trying to post the same &quot;those true religons are fake&quot; comment. I would like to let you know they are NOT fake. The denium is thick and heavy,not thin(a sign of a cheap knock offs) the true religion logo is on the buttons and zipper,ect..i have had them checked out by several people for authenticity and all have said yes they are the real thing, I feature several things on this video..all clearly real..sorry if you cant find a pair for 6 bucks but i did 
oops just saw that they do have TR knockoffs, but yours are not one 
i dont believe they make knock off True Religion jeans.. I have found a few True Religion jeans at yard sales and Church Rummage sales too... 
i dont believe they make knock off True Relgion jeans 
Those tried asre definitely not fake just look at the pockets especially on the first pair. Also I LOL&#39;d so hard at &quot;cause I&#39;m a hippy like that&quot; LMAO 
I loved this video thanks for showing us your finds. I love your style too. :)  
I want to know WHERE is the Good Will you shop at??? Wow, to find ALL those designer brand names is really amazing! 
That&#39;s amazing...I need to go thriftstore shopping... 
I found those one afternoon while doing my thrift store shopping. I have had ALOT of uncool rude people trying to comment on this video and say that the true religons are fake but i assure you they are not. The buttons,the stiching,the heavy thick denium ..all true religon. The back tag is old school but original. Most cheap knockoffs wont be made of heavy denium nor have the branded true religion buttons with the logo. If you are a hater go away. Im a smart shopper and i know it. 
WHATT 7 dollars??? ommmgg!! im deffinitley going thrift store shopping, how long did it take you to get those? 
OMG!! I Never New You Wear A Mom. Wow You Can Be A Model. I Do The Same Thing. I Past My Sons Clothes To My Other Son. Thank God. I Went Thrift Store Shopping For Them All the time For Great Prices. I Don&#39;t Care What Anyone Thinks. Hay As Long as are Kids look Good 7 Well Taken Care Of. OMG!! I Love the Sweater, My Son Would Loveeee The Bat Man Hoodie. Wow You Hit Jack Pot!!! I Cant Wait to Go thrift Shopping again. My City Sucks Because we Have Only 1 Thrift Store. Because I would Love to Shop around. Awesome Haul. <b>((HUGS))</b>...............................Cherylðxo? 
Aww so many cute clothes!?

@LittleMissClumbzie I am white...half german from my dad and then Russian and scandinavian from my mom :) you?? 
what ethnicity are u..? 
I love your hair in this vid. You should do a hair tutorial :) 
Thats funny ppl would ask my mom when i was really little if i was one of them...thanks though!!! it&#39;s a lot better then the last comment i had to block, they asked me if i was sure i wasn&#39;t a transvistite lol okkkaaay and told me i look manly LMAO 
I think you look like Ashley Olson in this vid! :) 
i have that bracelet! :] lovee the jeans! 
Aww that&#39;s so sweet of your bf! Those pants are cute on you! Great haul! That&#39;s not very mini for me, but compared to some youtuber&#39;s it probably is Lol. Your hair is really pretty in here btw, as well as your eyes! I love the way you line them! How do you keep your skin so gorgeous and clear? Sketch is really pretty on you! I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll look bruised if I get it, but I kind of want it lol. What is your nailpolish called, it&#39;s super pretty? 
I have seen counterfeit True Religion jeans at our SVDePaul store with everything you mentioned made them authentic. Â The true (see what I did there? Â ;P) way for me to see if they&#39;re genuine, is the stitching. Â If it&#39;s not perfect, I assume they&#39;re fake. Â The tag stitching should be pefectly aligned and even. Â It does drive me crazy that they &quot;fake and make&quot;.? 
Hello Michael, I am a bit confused with your pricing..??Â  I looked up in Amazon the Caddy shack Trivia game and it&#39;s only getting $18 max..where did you get $35?Â  Were u able to sell it for $35?Â  Not been critical or a pain in the anal cavity- ! thanks, Fara? 
I&#39;ve sold the Caddyshack game before. True Religion always makes me uneasy. I had a hat that was crazy designed. I basically wen with my gut. It was really well made with leather accents. Everything was sewn well and the fabric was thick. I was able to find similar designs in their jeans. The customer didn&#39;t return it so I guess they were happy with it.? 
Congratulations on the Amazon sales :)? 
No returns or exchanges at all at our GW stores..Wish we had some Salvation Army stores..I have a VCR new in box and can&#39;t list on Amazon because it says its restricted.. :(? 
My phone is going crazy. Sorry about the spaz message. Lol 
Sorry operator error on 
I was between sizes but as you said I don&#39;t want them to flip flop in the back. Just curious. I was glad to 
Just wondering if your TB Caroline&#39;s stretched out. I just bought these 
also theres only size 24 and 26 available... 
love the shoes!!!!!! Your make up looks great in this vid too!!!! 
DARLING TB shoes!! They go with those beautiful taupe eye colors! Waaah, now I want the LM palette.... FUN stuff you chose!! xoxoS 
i just ordered the lucky brand flats in black they look so cute i hope i&#39;ll like them on-thx for the review! 
@21earlthepearl I know I love her shoes to death! 
@thehipchickonline Thanks doll! 
Great haul! I love it all :-) 
Wow,I love the Tory Burch wedges. So pretty!
