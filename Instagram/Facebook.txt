Zara is quite a known brand but there are now quality issues. This is regarding leggings that i bought last month. After wearing it 2 times and then a wash made it so loose that i it slips down. Also the fitting because of which zara is trusted for has gone loose from knees which looks so bad. If this is the condition & quality of zara that after spending so much money i am getting this then it totally waste of my money. After wash (in normal temperature water) it looks like its so old as its fitting has gone, loose from waist, bulging knees. I sent an email regarding my problem but there isnt any reply yet. Hope to see an email in my inbox soon. 
Dear Zara, Why are the labels in all of your clothes so obnoxiously long? They are uncomfortable and can impact the shape. I could cut them out but half the time the spare buttons are stitched onto the very end! 
Which pair of sandals go better with this outfit? Is it the ZARA sandals or Joyfolie gladiators? #gladiator #styleink #styleinkjunior #sandals #kidsootd #fashionkid #babyM  
I had bought several cloths on June 20th. Roday I went to return some of them and they refused it. Store manager said today is after 30 days and she didnt accept to return or even exchange them. This is THE MOST REDICOLOUS POLICY I'VE HEARD. It doesnt make sence that you count both the day that I bought and the day that I return and say its over 30 days. I bought them on June 20th and made sure to return them on 20th. Even if its past for one day, MANAGER CAN NOT GIVE ME A STORE CREDIT? THIS IS THE WORSTE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND RETURN POLICY I'VE EVER SEEN. IN THIS I WOULD NEVER SET FOOT IN A ZARA STORE EVER. 
Easy like Monday morning. Reformation ZARA AQUAZZURA 
I am completely disappointed with the lack of customer service by a brand I have been extremely loyal too. Get it together Zara and stop with the deceiving business practices.

Thanks very much to Chris and S/G Cadigdig of Zara Rockwell. They took the trouble to turn off the store's sensors this afternoon before I entered so I could shop and then again when I left. Great customer service, thank you both and also to the rest of your team! More power, keep up the excellent service!

Kind Attn.: Customer Care Manager, Zara Dear Sir I have had a very poor incident where Zara Jaipur has vanished 4 denims/trousers purchased from them. After over 2 months of regularly following up with them, they say they cannot do anything about it. Following is the chain of events: a) On 3 Jan 2015, I purchased One Denims & One black trousers from Zara Jaipur. Copy of bill attached. b) On 11 Jan 2015, I purchased TWO Trousers (with belt ones). Unfortunately I do not have the bill. Time of purchase was between 1:30 pm and 2:30 pm. On same day I asked for Alteration service of these FOUR pants at Zara Jaipur counter. I was told that Sale is going on, so we cannot do alteration during sale. And they asked me to come after 14 Jan 2015. c) On 17 Jan 2015, I came to Zara Store again with all FOUR pants for alteration. I came in between 5:30 to 7pm. At Alteration counter, the sales person asked me to fill my contact details on one receipt which I did. Then he said he needs to make 4 receipts for 4 pants, and this will take some time (As there was lot of rush). I went around the store with my family for other shopping. Then I went after 15 mins again, but still he said it will take more time to make 4 receipts and asked me to come after 15 more mins. d) Eventually I had an emergency for which I had to rush at some place, and since I was short on time, I could not go back to Zara for collecting receipts. e) On 22 Jan 2015, I came asking for my FOUR pants, and they said they dont know anything about it!! They may have gone back to the shelves. How can they put back pants which are already sold back to the shelves???? f) On every visit of mine to Zara Jaipur, they kept telling me they are checking, half of the times the one or the other manager was not there. I am tired of following up. I have paid over Rs 10 thousand for these FOUR pants which I don't even have. I expect a solution for a reputed brand like ZARA. Either give me my pants or refund me the money. Regards Shivam Talwar +91-9929444222

I want to register my disappointment with Zara. Last year, I bought a pair of jeans at the 5th Avenue store, in NYC. With just a few months of use, it’s fabric was torn on the front. It had never happened to me, even with cheaper clothes. So, as a customer, I’d like an explanation from you.

HI, i lost my package due to the delivery carrier Fedex. I already talk to the Fedex but they require and arrangement from the shipper which is Zara to file a claim so i can have my refund. But when i call in , a representative deny to to that , i dont know why. i'm very frustrated right now.

I congratulate you on your amazing customer service. I have been arguing with them for 2 days over an order return. You never sent me the return label even though I have made a return request 3 weeks ago and when i called your customer service they say i am past the deadline. Even though my request was made in time and YOU are the one who didnt provide me with the label to return my order. Thank you Zara i will make sure never to buy online from you again. You should take you sister brands as an example. I buy from Pull an Bear all the time and never had an issue with them. 
Still no contact made.... What a bad service you truely are!!! Fuming!!!!! ?????

Zara I love your clothing design but biggest problem is with you that you are very egoist when material comes in very poor quality. When we had proof with bill, you always say email complaint to official email id and we cannot help you with this but your email will put blame on us. Very disgusting business.. now we are losing interest in you and will shift our focus on other better brand with better material quality along design than you. 
When the next level of sales will be started? 10x 
Zara... No regret... Your clothing designs are good, but your after sales support and quality of material is poor quality. Not one but we experienced it twice.... The worst part.... You go to the outlet where you bought and show them the poor quality, all that you hear is... Please email your complaint to official email id, we can't help you with this ... And... After a few days you get a email blaming you. Very good business model. I will never buy a Zara.... Disgusting! 
Hi do you do price adjustments? Or could I go to a store, return the item and buy it back?

Hello princess(;) Xxxxxxxxx 
Good evening guys! Sometimes in life we need to take a step back and reflect on things, reflect on ways and directions we want our lives to take, meditate on the importance of things and then let that reflect positively on the outside through our actions. Right, enough of that. There was a bit of colour blocking going on my end last Sunday and here is what I wore. Skirt ~ Marks & Spencer (Limited edition) Top ~ Matalan (old) Shoes ~ ZARA I must admit that I found these sandals quite comfortable and you won't catch me saying that often about most zara shoes. Have a lovely evening guys, talk to you soon xx

I had purchased a top from Zara. I wanted to get it exchanged. Unfortunately I misplaced the bill. I was asked by the store manager to drop a mail with details to the customer care to get an “Approval” for this exchange. They said that I will receive a response within 48 hrs. From Friday 10-Jul-15 till date no one has responded to me. I followed up on the email, no response there, and then I called up the customer care office too and got no definite answer. This service is highly disappointing and not expected from a brand this big. Date of purchase: 5-Jul-15 Location of the store: Phoenix market city, Bangalore Mail sent to Customer care on: 10-Jul-15 Followed up on 13-Jul-15 Called the customer care office (0124 4973500) on 14-Jul-15 And today 15-Jul-15 I have heard absolutely nothing from anyone. I hope someone cares enough and would respond to me at least now.

#ootd ZARA dress and shoes, jewelry from mom's closet... 
Zara is one of my favorite stores. However, my first time experience of ordering online has not been good. In the latter part of June this year, I ordered a few items online. July 1st, I receive an email from Zara's customer service informing me that there was a problem with the shipment of my order and because of that they would waive the shipping costs. July 7 I email them back because I still had not received my order. They wrote me back saying that my order was in fact delivered on June 30. How can it be delivered on June 30 when I received an email on July 1st about a problem with the delivery. Does not add up. So I called up customer service today and was told that it was indeed delivered on June 30. I said I did not receive the package and was there anything they can do for me. The customer service agent offered to give me the tracking number and said I should call Fedex and bring the issue to them. I said is that the only thing you can help me with? I said if I bring this up with Fedex they will just insist that the package has been delivered and their responsibility has been met. This incident is really disappointing. I will not order online anymore. It is very frustrating.

I've been buying your brand of jeans for a few years and was just about to purchase a new pair. Really dissappointed that you are now using a cheaper standard of denim and sewing techniques. For the price you charge for a pair, it's no longer worth it. Shame, they've always been my favourite fit and brand, time to try something new. So long 7!

Can you help me resolve a complaint? I have bought a bunch of 7 jeans over the years, but recently I bought a pair of jeans online and the fly is defective. It just falls down constantly, rendering the pants unwearable. My wife took them to a 7 store at Somerset Mall in Michigan and, despite having the receipt and the tag still on the pants, the store was unwilling to replace them and treated my wife poorly. This is how you lose customers. Please make this right!

I am really disappointed in your customer service. I ordered some pants and wore them once only to discover the seam on the right leg twists. I called your customer service line and was told to send them back, the pants would be "reviewed" and then I would "possibly" get an exchange. In the mean time I have to go without the pants I ordered. The option I was given was to buy the pants again. Or I was told I could wait a few days while "upper management" was contacted to see if the discount I had used could be reapplied to the pants I bought. I have already ordered the pants twice. I bought them on a Monday and on Wednesday received an email for 30% off. I called and asked if you could do a price adjustment since it was two days later. I was told no. So I bought the pants again at the discount and was going to send back the first pair. Why can't you empower your associates to help customers in the moment? I have always bought your pants from Nordstrom or Piperlime who have much better return policies and customer service. This is INCREDIBLY poor customer service.

I just ordered a shirt from you and paid for express shipping only to be told it was back ordered a day after it was supposed to have shipped. And you know how you get really excited about an outfit for a date and then extremely sad when you can't where it when you want to? Especially when you've expedited shoes to match? Really hope there's some sort of refund system in place re: express shipping payment. Sincerely, Deflated customer. :-(

VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER: I placed an order with you on the 26th of June paid in full and extra for express post shipping. I recieved a confirmation that it had been shipped however it never arrived, when i contacted Free people in relation to this I was told my my order was lost in transit and my express postage would be refunded (which it has not). I was then told that my order will be re shipped in 1-2 days. It took me to contact you, it would have been good practice to let me know what had happened. As the garments i had ordered were for an extremely important photo shoot my own business was conducting, leaving me to have to rechedule dates. Then I receieve this email from you......... this email is in reference to your recent order. Unfortunately, we were unable to process your order, as we could not obtain an authorization from your credit card company. You may wish to contact the issuing bank of your credit card regarding this matter, and then inform us of any additional information. We will hold your order for 48 hours, before it will be cancelled. Please respond quickly; merchandise cannot be held for your order and may become unavailable. For fastest results, please call us at the customer service number available on our website. Monday through Friday, 8 am to 8 pm, EST and a representative will be happy to assist you with this order. ????????? Why would you be trying to charge my credit car again, when my order was already paid for? Then tell me i should contact my bank ( Which i knew i did not need to ) AND then say you will hold my order for 48 hours before cancelling it????? WELL HOW KIND OF YOU TO HOLD AN ORDER I PAID IN FULL FOR! I responded to your email straight away after checking my bank receipts to find out i was infact charged the amount of $1,400 AUD and aking why you would be trying to take more money from me?? NO ONE has responded to any of my emails, I have now sent 5 in total asking for someone to contact me to tell me what is happening? After recieving no form of communication and living in Australia makes the time difference difficult for me to call, I actually got up ridiculously early today so that i could reach you. When i spoke to your representitive, she did not empathise with me in anyway and simply told me it had not been shipped as i owed 4 cents??????? Are you kidding I owe you 4 cents?? so you were holding my $1,400 order???? and not bothering to contact me in regards to this. When i purchase through a website it tells me how much i have to pay and it also takes the payment automatically from my card???? In actual fact my order was only $1,037.38 yet you took $1,400? but want another 4 cents? Your sales representative told me there was a glitch in your website and does this, so she credited the standard postage so the order could be sent out, however i paid EXPRESS post shipping, which she could no longer see due to the other sales person removing it in an earlier email? CONFUSED? ME TOO! I still do not know if my order has even been sent. and the person i spoke to was not even slightly compassionate over the phone. I am baffled at the lack of care and communications with your customers and let me tell you what a shame that is as i would have been a returning customer time and time again. I now will NOT be. I also wander how many other people this has happened too. Terrible service! If someone could bother to verify if my order has now been shipped that would be great, not holding my breath for a reply.

VERY UNHAPPY!! :-( the worst service ever! I paced a order over a week ago FA10076675, where you over charged me, sterling price instead of the euro price! I was never told that shipping from the uk there would be duties. when I was placing the order via the Euro/uk shite, I wasn't told Ireland had to pay duties. That was just 2 problems 1) being over charged to much money. over 100E to much is a lot of much, the dress was 270euor and you incorrectly charged me 250sterling, but difference.I can send you a screen shot of the price I if you want. 2) Duties ''I wouldn't mind paying if I knew from the start I had to. Moving on to trying to communicate with you. 3) I email and everyday someone else would tell me a very short answer, and never give me a full answer. 4) finally I got a email that was the worst ever, ''Your order is cancelled as the dress is not in STOCK'' after a 8 days of your keeping my 400euro. I am really sorry but this is just the worst service I have ever seen. You are definitely having international issues. I love your product. but how can you treat people like this after me spending time and giving you 400euro. I asked someone to call me to explain a few days ago. And they didn't even return my email. I am not just unhappy, I am mad at how you have treated me. I sent at least 8 emails most of them not even replies back, and if they were that were from people that seamed like them didn't really care. What do you have to say to all that??

ordering in your store, I thought I will get only positive emotions. at the stage of ordering it was, but initially for the order I paid more money. after receiving the order, two pairs of three I did not match in size. the deadline I sent the shoes back and wrote of this support. the store received the parcel on 15 June, and promised to return dengel 3-5 working days. but not returned. my emails store does not respond for 10 days. money I will not return, and it is 160$. it so happened that in the midst of the season I was left without summer shoes and no money to buy it elsewhere. at the moment in the us discounts, but I can not buy anything, because I don't have the money for it. very hurtful situation, the store would not comment on its actions. I will address the issue differently and turn in all possible instances, and also in court.

When it's too hot to get dressed...wearing Free People from HauteLook? 
Free People 
Hi! I'm hoping that I can get some help. About a month ago, I bought the Intimately Free Lila Maxi in preparation for my birthday (which was a few days ago). I always buy a special FP dress for my special day, it's one of my favorite traditions! Something that has been done for many years now. So, on my birthday a few days ago, I got the dress out to wear it for the first time--and, within three hours, the lace on the side was torn! It's a somewhat large tear that is noticeable. I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary that may cause a tear, and can't think of what could have caused it. Slightly devastating to have a $98 dress tear within the first few hours of being worn, especially on my birthday! If I go to my local FP store, would there be any way I could exchange it for a new, untorn dress?

It’s so easy to fall into doubt or awkwardness, but it’s imperative we listen to our bodies, their physical and emotional needs, and truly welcome and celebrate those big victories and small successes. That’s definitely something I’ve been able to find strength in, on and off my mat. - Free People

Dear H & M I would like to draw your attention to the kind of service (or rather lack threof) I received at your store on the Istiklal street in Istanbul which I visited on 24.07.2015 (evening) while I was on a vacation there. I visited the said store with a friend. I picked up a pair of boxers which were on sale and were now for 10 Turkish Liras, while my friend picked up a pair of sunglasses and a similar pair of boxers. While waiting in the line we thought we would get the billing done separately so we lined up at the cash counter with my friend ahead of me. Once my friend got his billing done and I approached the counter to get my billing done, a man (a local) came and barged into the line and spoke to the girl at the cash counter in their local language(possibly Turkish). They both exchanged a giggle and the man conveniently handed his stuff to the girl at the counter to get his billing done. When I object to this, the girl across the counter, whilst ignoring my objection, kept billing his goods. In spite of being irritated by such behaviour, I decided to not say anything further and simply get my billing done. After getting the billing done, when me and my friend were leaving the store we were behind the same local man. When we reached the store exit, the said local man exited while the sirens started ringing when we came near the door. Embarrassingly, we checked our packets. Upon checking, we found that the girl at the counter had not removed the electric tags from the merchandise we had bought. I volunteered to go back and get them removed while my friend waited outside. Now, as I went back and requested the girl to remove the tags she ignored my request and kept billing. By now I was quite annoyed and I believe the other girl (cashier) at the counter saw that and told the first one to attend to me after which she finally did remove the tags. However, as soon as I came out and checked with my friend, I realised that the product I bought was supposed to be on sale and the cashier had billed it for 25 liras (actual price ) instead of 10 liras (sale price) . I had paid 50 Liras and I was supposed to get back 40 Liras as the boxers were on sale whereas i only got back 25 Liras. Visibly annoyed, I went back to the counter and requested the girl to give me the actual balance. To my utter disgust she again ignored my request and kept at whatever she was doing whilst other customers watch on. The second cashier girl, upon noticing the ignorant attitude being meted out to me by the first cashier called me at her counter and finally gave me my balance back. I have a copy of the said bill/receipt with me. As a regular H & M customer, I have been to your stores in Dubai, London and USA. However, I have not received such racially discriminating and annoying treatment anywhere. I do hope that you look into this seriously and take the said person to task to avoid tarnishing your image.

Since its invention in 1873, the 501® jean has taken on a life of its own as a beloved icon of culture and style around the world. Watch as it progresses through history, evolving with the world around it. Today, we celebrate the #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
The oldest pair of Levi’s in existence date back to 1879. It’s kept in a fire-proof safe in the Levi’s archives, to which only two people know the combination. At the time, we said the pants were : ‘for men who toil’, who wore them out, patched them up, passed them on… They were, and still are, built to last. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
By the early 1950s, denim went from work clothes to work & play clothes. Women started wearing jeans to make a style statement. A trend that has stood the test of time. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
In 1934, the first blue jeans for women, Lady Levi’s, was created. A powerful message of equality…and a prolific fashion statement. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
The swinging 60s was an era in which jeans were an expression of individuality and freedom. Levi’s began selling bell-bottoms on March 11, 1969 — just in time for Woodstock. A connection with music that lasted. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
In 1886, the Two Horse ® patch was first used to demonstrate the strength of the pants and reinforce our status as the originator of riveted jeans. A letter from 1938 recounts the adventures of Californian Elton Schram, who towed his neighbour’s car with a pair of Levi’s. A testament to strength, pulled off in style. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
Levi Strauss opened its first San Francisco factory to manufacture denim pants. The original design, called ‘XX’, was eventually assigned lot number 501. Just like that, an icon was born. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN 
In 1853, Levi Strauss arrived in San Francisco, carrying with him durable denim work pants for sale. Two decades later, a method to rivet the pants’ pocket corners to make them stronger was invented. This changed the way the world dressed forever. #BIRTHDAYOFTHEBLUEJEAN #501Day

I wear only Levi's denims... So I decided to gift myself Levi's this Diwali. We purchased clothing worth 8K plus from Levi's, Viviana mall... I totally forgot about my Levi's Loop card and cashier at the store never bothered asking for it. When I went for some alteration work after 2 weeks I suddenly remembered that I have a Levi's Loop membership. I requested the store manager to add my 8K purchase points to my loop card and he said it cannot be done now as billing system is online... That was the dumbest excuse given by someone. Guys at Hypercity also add points later if you don't carry the card and don't recollect your membership number. Is only customer responsible to get these points added? There is no responsibility on cashier's part? On top of that they simply forgot to alter my jeans. When I went to collect it, they gave reasons like machine wasn't working etc. They had my number but did not bother informing me about it. Didn't expect such a thing from Levi's... Totally disappointed... 
The perfect jeans. Cozy cardigans. Fresh new accessories. Better Together.

“I've been a True Religion fan since I started my fashion blog, which is when I first learned the value of owning a pair of quality jeans. I love True Religion not just because of the amazing denim collections that fit like a dream, but also because I admire and relate to the brand's fearless sense of style. They encourage their customers to have their own stylish voice.” #BeSoBold contest Grand Prize Winner, @ohtobeamuse 
FEARLESS STYLE LEADER + $1,000 Grand Prize Winner of the #BeSoBold contest, San Francisco blogger and online marketer @ohtobeamuse, tells us how True Style made her famous. “I was inspired to submit my photos to the True Religion #BeSoBold contest because I think it's great to step out of your comfort zone every now and then. The best way I know how to do that is with my personal style. The easiest way to describe my style is that it's casual chic. I like to be comfortable in everything I wear, which includes a lot of jeans, while also making a bold statement at the same time.” Shop @ohtobeamuse's outfit: Utility Colorblock Shirt: Casey Super Skinny Tiger Camo Jean:
