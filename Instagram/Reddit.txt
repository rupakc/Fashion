Long time lurker, first time poster. I’m hoping you ladies can help me out with something that’s been driving me CRAZY. Every time I try to wear tights it just looks WRONG. I don’t understand how other girls can look so effortless and feminine while I just look… floppy I guess? [Here is a recent pair I’ve What is going on here? Do I need to size up? Size down? Try a different brand? This is sooo frustrating. 
**If you're reading this, please upvote so it hits the radar of lurkers and casual subscribers who only see the post on their front page. And since it's just an announcement, it wouldn't be the worst thing if folks from /r/all saw it.** **It's a self-post *and* I have my mod tag on, so you *double-extra-venti* don't have to worry about me getting karma from it.** ---- From Sunday May 5th through Sunday May 19th, we're going to flip the switch to make /r/malefashionadvice a self-post-only sub. That means you won't be able to include links (imgur, blogs, store websites, etc) in the title of your posts, although you can certainly still include them in the body of a text post. We're hoping you'll supplement that link with [more detail and and that it will generate better discussion *and better advice for you* than a simple "Whaddya think" imgur link. For example, [we made the move to self-posts for inspiration albums a few weeks ago (plus a few additional and while it has decreased the quantity of this type of posts, many would say it has increased their quality. At the same time, however, it has also changed how many MFA subscribers are exposed to these albums. [Searching for inspiration album and sorting by shows that most new inspiration album posts are getting 100-200 upvotes consistently. Before the guidelines for inspiration albums changed, the spread was much greater - many got no traction at all while others hit the top of the sub (and /r/all) with 500-2000+ votes. The trade-off, in other words, has been context for exposure. Now we're going to give it a trial period for all of /r/malefashionadvice. Some of you will love the change, some of you will hate it, and [there will probably be some fodder for I've outlined some of my concerns /u/schiaparelli (a moderator for /r/femalefashionadvice and all-around cool cat) eloquently responded with her thoughts and FFA's experience and What we ask is that everyone - whether you've lobbied for the change, think it's a terrible idea, feel meh about it, or have never thought about it before - *keeps an open mind*. Regular users, lurkers, brand-new subscribers alike - we hope you'll give a little bit of thought to the character of MFA over the next couple weeks, and participate in the wrap-up/assessment post on Sunday the 19th. How did it change the community? *Did* it at all? For the better? For the worse? How so? If you're new, try to put yourself in the shoes of a long-time regular. If you're a regular contributor, try to put yourself in the shoes of a brand-new subscriber. And, of course, everyone should put themselves in the shoes from the just-released New Balance^TM Yacht Club collection, because all of the mods are corporate shills getting paid under the table. **Snuzzles and lovies,** **The MFA mods** 
MFA has a lot of resources for newbies who are trying to dress better. But most of the advice catered here is focused on *what pieces you should buy* and not on *how these pieces interact*. We have great guides on creating **wardrobes**, but I feel we lack a guide that adresses how to create **outfits**. The result is that many newcomers end up not knowing how to avail the full potential of their wardrobe or how to take advantage of the clothes they already own. Of course, building wardrobes and outfits go hand in hand. It's a lot easier to create nice outfits if you have a wardrobe full of pieces that fit you both physically and stylistically. At the same time, it's good to think what kind of outfit you want to create when you're buying stuff. Now, I should warn you, I'm not an expert on this. I have little more than a year's experience in fashion and most of what I learned comes from MFA itself. So what I want here is to discuss a few guidelines on how to put together individual pieces so that they come together to form something good, as well as avoiding common pitfalls for beginners. I'm sure it's not complete though. There is much more to that than I could possibly explain. I would appreciate very very much if someone more knowledgeable (or more skilled with the english language) than me wants to complement my text in the comments. --- **The basic principles of design** &gt;*To achieve visual unity is a main goal of graphic design. When all elements are in agreement, a design is considered unified. No individual part is viewed as more important than the whole design.* -Alex White, in *The Elements of Graphic Design*. I stumbled upon [this a while ago here in MFA. This small list of principles of design helped me understand better what makes an outfit work or not. The first of them is **unity** (aka cohesion or synergy). Lack of it is one of the main reasons some outfits in the WAYWT or OFFC threads don't work. If your shoes say something and your jacket says something else, the whole outfit won't look right. Basically, *the outfit should be seen as a whole, not as a sum individual parts.* This is probably the most important "lesson" in this guide, and I will return to it before the text is over. This applies to many elements in the outfit: fit, colour, level of formality, style, etc. That is not to say that there can't be a **hierarchy** between different pieces from an outfit. It's ok to have one of the pieces as the focal point, as long as the outfit is designed to *support* it instead of clashing with it. In [this (thanks, disby), the eye is drawn first to the camo shorts, because of the busy pattern, then to the shoes, because of the bright colour, and lastly to the muted t-shirt. So there is a hierarchy here in which the shorts are the "strongest" element and the tshirt is the "weakest" one. What I mean here as a "strong" element is something that draws attention to itself, either because it has a heavy or because the stands out, or because the is different, etc. (thanks Balloons_lol, fucks_mulder and huhwot) When putting together an outfit with items that have different "strengths", it is important to be careful in order to maintain a certain **balance**. What that means is that putting too many "strong" elements in one part of the outfit (top, bottom, left, right) usually won't look good as distributing them along the outfit. Take [this (thanks, only56), for example. The tie and the shoes are the *strong* elements, while the shirt and pants are relatively muted. It would look a lot worse if he had gone with strong tie and shirt and muted shoes and pants, because the strong elements would clash and the outfit would look unbalanced. When an element is just [TOO it's usually advised to keep the rest of the outfit relatively muted. --- **The importance of context and creating an image** &gt;*Actors seek to fulfill the obligations encapsulated in a role, an identity, a membership in a political community or group, and the ethos, practices and expectations of its institutions. Embedded in a social collectivity, they do what they see as appropriate for themselves in a specific type of situation.* -James G. March and Johan P. Olsen, in *The logic of appropriateness*. [This recent teaches us something that is actually pretty obvious: for most people fashion isn't interesting just because of the clothes, it's interesting because of it affects how people perceive you. This is the reason most people get into fashion - they are unsatisfied by how they present themselves to others, and are captivated by the idea of being able to *choose* how their peers will perceive them. In that way, fashion is empowering. (there's been [another recent by milky_funk that has something to do with this) So when you ask yourself what clothes you want to wear, keep in mind that the actual question is *how do I want to look?* You're not just using pieces of fabric to cover your body, you're trying to create an **image** for yourself. And just how appropriate or "good" this image is depends entirely on the **context** it's inserted. Context here means many things: where (in the world, in your country, in your city) you're from, how old you are, what you do, what's the occasion, etc. Fashion varies wildly across the globe, and what is expected from a 16 year old high-schooler is different from what is expected from a 50 year-old businessman. Keep that in mind: who you are and where you live also play a role in the image I mentioned in the previous paragraph. This is why sometimes getting fashion advice and inspiration from the internet may feel disconnected from the reality. Fashion blogs will tell you that every man *needs* a navy blazer, or raw denim, and that just isn't true. These "essential pieces for a man's wardrobe" lists take clothes out of their context and strip them of their meaning. My preferred approach is different ([/fa/'s website preaches a similar Pay attention to the ones around you. What do people in your environment wear? Ask yourself how you want to look in contrast to them. Do you want to fit in and look attractive? Do you want to look rebellious and make people uncomfortable? Do you want to look professional and respectable? Do you want to look older? Younger? These are all valid desires and they should guide how you approach fashion. The choice of how you want to look should be a conscious one, based on your desires and expectations to the context that surrounds you. ([More on this --- **Applying all that: fit, colour, formality, style, etc.** &gt;*This question goes far beyond what you wear. It points to how you engage with life and how life unfolds through you. This is a question of perceiving something that is already happening, not about trying to find the 'right' idea. It's about seeing into an organic process rather than deciding something out of the blue.* -TheHeartOfTuxes, in his [magnificent about [finding your own I want here demonstrate how the principles (particularly cohesion) mentioned so far can be applied to different outfit elements. * First of all, **fit** (and **silhouette**). Although MFA has a skinny bias, there is some variation in what is considered an *acceptable* fit. You should, however try to achieve a certain unity and balance through the outfit. A looser fit all around look (thanks huhwot and lobstertainment), as a full blown (thanks LeTigreLeTigre and sweetjesusonfire). Another way to achieve balance is to a ["heavier" top with a [skinnier (thanks Pokesteve and freench). *I know this section is terribly incomplete, if somebody wants to expand this subject, please do so. For now, I'll just leave a link here to the [wonderful on fit and proportions by Schiaparelli for FFA. Hey, now schoonerism [did for us in MFA too!* * **Colour** is next. Colour is hard to explain, but you usually want to have a *colour scheme* for an outfit. That means a limited combination of colours that work together in a cohesive way. Blue, gray, white and brown is perhaps the most classic and the easiest scheme to work with in male fashion and usually loooks great on both and outfits (thanks desmigalhation and skinniouschinnious). Monochromatic schemes are harder to [make but can look [very (thanks Azurewrath and milky_funk!). For more info on colour, these guides are useful: [the seasonal [the biomimicry and [FFA's * Common mistake when starting to dress: **formality** clash. Many clueless newcomers, based on the common but erroneous notion that dressing up is dressing better, try to "class up" a casual outfit by throwing a single, isolated formal piece on top of it. Usually a fedora, a waistcoat, a tie or a suit jacket. It usually ends up looking See how the jacket says "formal" while the other pieces say "casual", ruining any hope of unity this outfit might have achieved otherwise? ^((disclaimer: this was posted with the consent of the subject in the picture)^) * It's usually advisable to have some **style** unity in an outfit as well. What I mean here is that an outfit should say one single message instead of mixing different messages together. If you look rugged from head to toe, the "concept" will be easily understood. If you put on a dress shirt, a pair of slacks, dress shoes and a military field jacket, the concept is lost and the outfit is confusing. * The is a great example of something that tends to not look good. But is it *possible* to work a fedora into an outfit? I put together [a few of outfits with fedoras that maybe don't look quite as bad as the ones you usually see. The point is that here the hat is **cohesive** with the outfit, something that is quite hard to do nowadays. You may not like them, though, as I said it's quite hard to make it work. --- **A short note on "breaking the rules"** &gt;*John Cage didn’t simply stick a bunch of spoons inside a piano and compose avant-garde masterpieces – his prepared piano pieces were an organic development out of years of studying, performing, experimenting and the influence of Indian musical forms and philosophy.* -Syeknom, in *[Fashion and a Cup of Keep in mind that these guidelines are just here to help you understand fashion better, with the ultimate purpose of achieving control over your image. These aren't unbreakable laws, just some loose recommendations based mainly on my personal experience and observation. It is, of course, possible to look good even if you break some of these rules, for example wearing [formal in casual outfits (thanks veroz). The thing is that, if you try this as a beginner, you're most likely to fail. --- **Closing thoughts** Ok, this turned out half a personal rant half a guide.

I think this is surprisingly cute. She notes that a couple things were outfits she liked and would do again. This seems like a great way to think outside the box, as well as force yourself out of a comfort zone. Any thoughts? [Link 
So today I purchased a destructed boyfriend flannel shirt. I got home and was inspired so I put together 8 looks with the shirt as the central item in each outfit! 1. A classic preppy fall look with riding boots and a varsity sweater- 2. This is a "military look" complete with army green jacket and combat boots- 3. I felt really cool wearing this, no lie. Some destructed boyfriend jeans, oversized tee and ankle cowboy boots- 4. A low-key easy outfit, what's comfier than vans?- 5. Probably my favorite dressier look. Ankle trousers with a navy blazer and adorable mouse flats!- 6. Another preppy outfit, Breton stripes, baggy bottomed azure hued pants and navy pointy toed pumps- 7. Why not nautical? Graphic tee, pencil skirt, and point toed pumps- 8. Last but not least, another grunge look. Oversized sweater, black tights and sweet ankle boots- 9. (Added) I wasn't planning on posting this, but hey I like it so I hope y'all do too! Another effortless cool outfit with a knit beanie and ankle cowboy boots!- The flannel is from Kohl's! Close-up of shirt- I hope y'all liked my use of the shirt and if there's any clothing details you want to know, I'll gladly provide!(: Thanks! EDIT: Due to the overwhelming number of messages in my inbox regarding my bun- here is a tutorial on how I do it! EDIT 2: After so much interested I've added one more look! 
Thank you all for the overwhelmingly helpful responses I got when I first posted. I ended up using Rent the Runway as many of you suggested and here is the final look! Posing out in front of "Urban Lights" at LACMA. And caught in a tabloid photo behind Calista Flockhart. Here are the quick stats of the entire ensemble: -GOWN (I got the size 12R and 14L, the 12R had the better fit): -SHOES (I wanted to wear flats for comfort, though due to my height even the R length dress was about an inch too long on me): -CLUTCH (in black, though I can only find a link to red now): -JEWELRY (Huge thank you to Sophie at Pearls International who contacted me after my original post here on reddit and lent me the gorgeous pearl collar, bracelet, and studs I wore. Thanks /u/sophievision !!! They will be in the mail back home tomorrow!) -HAIR: Done by Floyds 99 Barber Shop in Mar Vista -MAKEUP: Done by Liana at Sephora Century City The one downside of using Rent the Runway was that I was not alone. Throughout the night I saw many of the other dresses I considered from RTR walking around and entering through security, even one woman wearing the same dress as I was (we both congratulated each other on great taste and quickly moved as far away from each other as possible. haha). However, the upside of having such an attention getting dress is that, well, it got me some attention! Thank you to /u/peachybutton and /u/motherofdragons for messaging me and letting me know I actually got a shoutout from the ladies at Go Fug Yourself after appearing in the background of a photo with Calista Flockhart. (And if you have twitter, I don't, let them know I was humbled and thrilled to get a mention alongside all the impeccably dressed stars!) Linky: Finally, if you care to see more of the dress, and the event in general, here is a big (and I mean seriously long) album of my entire day getting ready and being at the show. There's some more information in the descriptions of the photos, but if you have any questions, feel free to comment here or PM me! It was truly a once in a lifetime experience. Thank you so much FFA! You're all lovely. :D 
The first time I took a self pic for WAYWT I learned something: it is harder than it looks to take a good self pic. How I saw myself in the mirror looked way better than the pictures I had taken. Since then, I've gotten a bit better and so I thought I'd share some tips. Most photos posted to MFA fall into two categories: "fit check" and "show off." **General Tips:** * **Good lighting is the most important thing for any photo.** Without good lighting, shots will be blurry, details will be lost and in general you'll look like crap. You may notice that a lot of top WAYWT posts are taken outdoors: nothing beats the sun for great light (full daylight is ~1000 times brighter than a typical lamp). * Make sure you're not back lit. Light should be coming from an angle in front of you (e.g., above and in front or from your side and in front). * If you're having trouble getting good light inside open every shade and turn on every light. * Use the on-camera flash as a last resort. It gives a lot of light at the cost of flattening everything out. Also, flash + mirror = glare. * Clean your camera lens. If you're using your bathroom mirror, clean that too. * A good camera/lens helps a lot, but not as much as good light. A shot taken outdoors with good natural lighting in the golden hour with a point and shoot will look much better than one taken inside with a DSLR using the on-camera flash. Here are two pictures taken with the same camera, of the same outfit demonstrating the importance of light: * [Handheld through a mirror with typical household lighting, mostly coming from * [Using a tripod with lots of natural light coming from the **Fit Check:** This is for when you're looking for input on how an outfit fits/looks. The most important thing is to give people a clear, accurate view of how the clothes look on you. * **Keep your hands out of your pockets!** Leave them both relaxed at your sides (or one if the other hand is holding the camera). * [Stand in a straight, natural pose facing the camera. Don't suck in your stomach or pull your shoulders * If possible, include additional pictures from the side and back. * Show the whole outfit including shoes, unless you're only interested in a shirt/jacket. * Ideally, use a camera with a timer/remote instead of a mirror (there are apps for most phones that can set a delay and number of pics to take, such as Photo Timer for the iphone). * For god's sake don't post a picture that needs to be rotated 90 degrees. * If you're holding the camera, keep your elbows close to your body. Raising your elbow to the side will lift the body of a jacket or coat, distorting the fit. * People aren't used to seeing outfits from waist level. Position the camera at least chest high, preferably neck high. Your proportions will look odd if the camera is too low. * If your clothes are dark, lighting is doubly important. * If it's a suit or jacket, wear it with a dress shirt and shoes. Also button it. Leave the bottom button undone on a two or three button suit. **Show-off:** This is for cases where you're not really looking for a fit check, you just want to show an outfit off on WAYWT. * Lighting is still the most important thing. If you're outside, the best time is morning or evening (the so-called "golden hour") when the sun is low and will give everything great dimension. * Try different poses. It's okay to put your hand in your pocket or stand in 3/4 profile if you're not getting a fit check. * Use a tripod and timer/remote. It makes it much easier to get a whole outfit shot and eliminates blurriness caused by unsteady hands. * Avoid distracting backgrounds. * If your camera has manual controls, go for a wide aperature (low f number). This creates a shallow depth of field, which will help you stand out from the background. It also increases the shutter speed, for less motion blur. * Have fun. Feel free to be creative. Don't take this too seriously. For more tips, see FFA's guide ["On Improving Your Fashion If anyone has any additional tips, please share. I'm not a professional photographer or even a great amateur. 
I am so excited about the season changing that I just wanted to share my current inspiration! This fall I want to escape the coming sea of plaid! I want to steer clear of black. I am banning the hoodie-and-jeans stand by! I am envisioning a delicate, feminine fall; a season that is all is about chunky knits in soft colors, dark florals, brown leather, lace details, gold jewelry, layering, and hosiery galore. Oh and of course, SWEATERS! 
*Hi FFA. It seems we have a more or less constant stream of requests for body-type advice. Here is my attempt to write something to address this that doesn't assume everyone strives towards the One True Silhouette and that also hopefully doesn't suck.* **On Dressing Your Body Type** **I. "Body Types" are Crap** (Off to a great start!) The first thing we need to address is the limitation of the whole "body type" approach. Let's explicitly lay out the underlying assumption of the goals of most "dress for you body type" guides: **Premise 1**: People come in a few different kinds of shapes; **Premise 2**: One of those shapes (tall, slim hourglass) is the best shape; **Conclusion**: Therefore other shapes should dress in such a way as to best give the impression of a tall, slim hourglass. I think both of these premises are flawed, though for slightly different reasons. In the first case, people come in such a huge variety of different combinations of features and proportions that the commonly used categories (pear, apple, banana/ruler, strawberry/inverted triangle) become nearly meaningless. /u/thethirdsilence has an excellent discussion of this in her [How To: Determine Your Body guide. The second premise is not exactly false in the 2+2=5 sense, but it is an arbitrary personal preference that you need not share. If you prefer to dress so that you look like a strawberry/inverted triangle, that is a perfectly valid style goal which would be completely unserved by any "dress your body type" guide I've ever seen. OK, but I told you we would have a guide to dressing your body type. So here is what we'll do. **II. Mix-n-Match Guide to Dressing Your Body Type** All we can really do is draw attention to different parts of the body. That's all "Dress Your Body Type" guides are doing: they are telling you which body parts to draw attention to, and which ones to draw attention away from, in order to make your body look most like a tall slim hourglass. So rather than assume you want to look like a tall slim hourglass, we'll just talk about how to draw attention to different body parts, and let you pick the parts you'd like to highlight and minimize. Here's some examples: * A ruler who wants to do the extreme 50's/New Look hourglass. FOCUS: bust, waist, hips DEFOCUS: shoulders, belly * An hourglass who wants to look more androgynous. FOCUS: Shoulders, legs. DEFOCUS: bust, waist, hips. **III. General Principles** If you want to make something look bigger, you can either add physical volume or add visual weight. If you want to make something look smaller, you're usually stuck with putting visual weight elsewhere (since if we could remove physical volume at will the whole diet industry would have collapsed). Adding physical volume is pretty straightforward. This just means that you're going to wear your clothes so that they stand out from your body a bit in the area you want to look bigger. and even are all ways to accomplish this. Visual weight is a little more nebulous. This is the idea that certain elements of a composition will draw the viewer's eye more strongly than others. If you think of your clothed body as a composition of sorts, then you can fool viewers into thinking that certain body parts are larger than they really are by tricking the viewer's eye into spending more time focusing on those body parts. We say that elements that successfully draw the viewer's eye have more visual weight. In general, you can give a body part more visual weight with [light ([especially [bright [shiny and [bold If you want to make a body part appear smaller, you're trying to do the opposite: you want the viewer's eye to spend as little time as possible on that part before moving on. So here you'd be looking for [dark and [matte (This is where the "black is slimming" advice comes from.) One last important factor is the power of unbroken lines. If you want something to appear longer, make sure it appears as a single unbroken shape, so that the eye can move smoothly from one end to the other. If you want something to appear shorter, break it into smaller segments. This can apply to the whole body makes her look taller than because the top and pants are the same color), or to the the leg line ([nude are a common example), or to anything else you'd like to lengthen or shorten. That's all there is to it! However, I'd rather do this than work, so let's do some examples with specific body parts. **IV. Case Studies** A. **Shoulders** i. To give them *more* focus: [color [crazy ii. To give them *less* focus: [raglan [dolman [deep sccop/V (this breaks up the horizontal line across the shoulders, making it appear shorter). Also, try emphasizing your hips. B. **Bust** i. To give it *more* focus: [empire [breast ii. To give it *less* focus: [unadorned also try emphasizing the shoulders or hips. C. **Waist** A note on the waist: So remember up top, when we said that giving things visual weight makes them look bigger? That means that if you try to draw a lot of focus to your waist you may end up making it look bigger. If a small waist is one of your figure goals, dressing is going to be a balancing act between drawing attention to the waist so that the viewer will notice it is small, and drawing attention away from the waist so that it appears smaller. Just know that [adding visual weight to the waist will rarely make the waist appear (This is why I disagree with the "Add a belt to create a defined waist!" school of advice.) That being said: i. To give it *more* focus: [contrast waist [other waist ii. To give it *less* focus: [dresses without a waist or Also try emphasizing shoulders, bust, hips, or legs. D. **Belly** i. To give it *more* focus (I suspect this is going to be an unpopular figure flattery goal, but what the hell): [belting or or [over the (sorry for the unflattering example picture -- this is just such an uncommon figure goal that there are very few pictures of people wearing this style), [an obviously distorted with a full skirt; ii.

Conclusions** You'll notice that the "To give it more focus" section is usually a lot longer. I think this is mostly due to the ["Don't think about a pink elephant!" any whiff of visual trickery makes people want to look at that area more, not less. Most of the minimizing advice relies on making the area you want to minimize extremely boring, and picking something else to be the focus of attention. If you want to continue the pink elephant analogy: it's easier to get people to not think about a pink elephant by yelling about a green armadillo instead. The exception seems to be the waist/belly area, and I'm not sure why. I have three ideas: 1. Negative space: The waist is usually expected to be smaller than other body parts around it, so we're used to seeing outfits that hide the waist to some extent. Consequently, deliberately hiding the waist doesn't look weird. 2. Current fashion: The currently fashionable silhouette is pretty much lollipop-on-a-stick: skinny pants with a voluminous top. Consequently, we are used to seeing silhouettes that supress the waist as fashionable and attractive. 3. Personal blinders: I, /u/jkkldfgjklfkl, am least comfortable with this area of my body. Consequently, I've spent more time thinking about minimizing this area than others. (If you think this is it, come at me in the comments with more suggestions and I will edit!) Finally, I just want to reiterate that you do not need to strive for the culturally-prescribed tall slim hourglass when you dress. Everybody has different figure flattery goals, including "IDGAF". You do you. 
I have long hoped that this topic would be discussed, but as that has not happened since I have been here, I have decided to post my personal thoughts on the matter in hopes of creating some discussion and bringing to light some issues. The last thing I’m intending to do is criticize or scold anyone individually. I realize this is a controversial topic, and as such I have done my best to write a measured and considerate post. This has been on my mind for a while now, but I’ve just now gotten around to writing out my thoughts. And please take this for what it is: my thoughts as a member of the community. Basically, here’s the situation: every so often a member or a new person will post here looking for fashion advice or opinions on clothing they’re wearing. If you’ve been around here for very long, you’ll know that one thing that is not uncommon (especially if the person is over- or underweight) is for commenters to post unsolicited fitness advice. It’s not an *enormous* issue, such that all fashion advice is abandoned in favor of commanding them to lift weights, but I have seen it often enough that I think it is worth a discussion. First off: I realize that many people who post such comments are sincere. It’s not intended as a jab. Additionally, most of the time these comments are even accurate. Yes, it is true. People who have fit, muscular bodies are more attractive. Most of the time the advice is spot on: losing weight and lifting weights *would* help the person look better. However, I am of the opinion that that in no way justifies giving fitness advice to people asking for fashion advice in a fashion forum unless it is in the recurring designated “Hair, Skincare, Fragrance, and Fitness” thread or was specifically asked for. Here’s why: **1. It wasn’t asked for** Considering it’s fitness and lifting advice, I would think people would know this. When you go to a gym, you do not walk up to people and start giving them tips unless they are in immediate danger of injuring themselves. Chances are you’ve seen a guy at your gym do this, and chances are you wish he would stop. It’s rule #1 in gym etiquette, and there is a very good reason for that. So why do it here? It wasn't asked for. You dont know that person’s goals, life, limitations, or what they’re trying to accomplish. **2. It doesn't contribute to discussion** This is a fashion forum. It’s about fashion. Yes, no one is denying that people look better when they’re fit. But this isn’t /r/howtobehandsome or /r/lookingattractivetowomenadvice. When a person comes here for fashion advice, they are coming here for fashion advice. Fitness advice is completely beside the point. You’re not sharing any new knowledge or insight. People dont read your comment and say “Oh, I never noticed that before, I had never considered becoming fit. That’s an excellent point.” In fact, that person is here specifically for fashion advice. If they wanted fitness advice, they wouldn’t have come here, they’d be somewhere else. You are not contributing to the discussion or helping that person in an way. **3. It is off-putting and comes off as derogatory, and as such, it is detrimental to the MFA community** A huge percentage of these comments come in the form of a curt, unhelpful sentence: “lift, bro” or “if you want to look good in clothes, you have to be fit.” If someone walked up to you on the street and said that to you, how would you react? ‘Fitness tip bros’ at the gym are almost universally despised for being presumptuous, condescending, and unhelpful. What about this scenario is any different? Chances are, the person is *fully aware* that they have a less than perfect body. They are clearly already trying to improve their appearance by asking for advice. They may even have confidence issues which has spurred their desire to improve their appearance (in fact, that is a very common scenario). You don’t need to shove their imperfections back in their face. They may simply be trying to tackle one thing at a time, and such comments are discouraging. They may have some limitation that prevents them from pursuing fitness, and are trying to instead improve their appearance by dressing better. Or heaven forbid they may just simply have a different opinion of their ideal figure or have no desire to pursue fitness at all. Once again, you don’t know that person’s goals, life, limitations, or what they’re trying to accomplish. _____ MFA has long fought against the stereotype that it is elitist and condescending. Yet we allow elitist and condescending attitudes and comments that contribute nothing to discussion to go unchecked (once again, I have no doubt that many of these comments are sincere and intended to be helpful. However, as I have discussed, I believe that in practice, the end result is neither). It is well known that there are proportionally very few consistent contributors that fall into the ‘bigger guys’ category. Each and every time a Best Of WAYWT hits /r/all, this is brought up, and comments are made that nearly all posters shown are slim or fit. So often, in fact, that it is addressed in the official FAQ posted in the comments of every one of these albums, shown below. &gt; **Why so few larger dudes in this album?** &gt; MFA's a place that helps users regardless of their body type, which is why some of our users have put together an album of heavier guys looking good and a guide to dressing well. As to the lack of heavier guys in the album, it's a fair question. MFA's not purposefully excluding them, for sure. No, MFA does not purposefully exclude them, but unsolicited fitness advice undeniably makes posting here less welcoming and much more uncomfortable. I have no doubt that most people would never dream of intending to belittle and shame bigger guys, and are merely trying to be helpful. However, ‘lifting tips bro’ at the gym also believes he is only being helpful; clearly intentions are not the only important thing. I don't believe it is entirely coincidental that our body type demographics for consistent posters are what they are. There may be multiple reasons for that, but I think fear of body shaming is one factor. If we truly want to encourage people of all body types to contribute and feel welcomed, this behavior should end. And I know I’m not the only person who feels this way. The entire FFA community has already taken extensive official measures to prevent these types of comments because they caused members to have insecurities and feel unwelcome. Clearly it is a very real problem, and had to be addressed by the moderating team. Official policy can be found but I’ve quoted an excerpt below: &gt; The goal of FFA is to discuss fashion; there are other, well-established forums that deal with fitness, body dysmorphia, body acceptance, and eating disorders. We have neither the interest nor the capability to moderate posts of that nature (and you guys don’t subscribe to us to discuss them anyway). The goal is simple: always help users dress for the body they have, and do not make any assumptions about the body they want. Posts of the following nature will be removed: &gt; * unsolicited medical, fitness, or nutritional advice * commentary on any user’s body except in the context of how clothes fit on it * body-shaming of any kind * posts advocating eating disorders I believe FFA’s policy is very wise. Some would argue that it is a bigger problem with women, but if you believe men are incapable of feeling insecure or hurt because of comments about their bodies, you are dead wrong. FFA has also added fitness to their personal grooming weekly post, “Hair, Makeup, Skincare, Fitness, and Fragrance.” This gives people a place and chance to talk about such things appropriately within the community, while avoiding any of the aforementioned consequences. /u/inherentlyawesome has been posting a very similar thread here, in which it would also be appropriate to discuss fitness in this community. I believe adopting a policy similar to FFA’s would be a welcome addition and improvement to the MFA community. Short of this, lets at least try to discourage unsolicited fitness advice and comments about bodies, as a community. This should be a welcoming place for people of any body type to seek advice about fashion. That is, after all, the entire purpose of this sub. In conclusion, I am of the opinion that, outside of the fitness recurring thread and unless someone is specifically asking for fitness advice, giving it is completely out of place. If it were simply unhelpful (which it is) I don't believe it would be a big deal. However, when it alienates part of the community (which it does), that’s when it becomes a problem. I’m not asking for a revolution or a major policy change or anything like that (although I certainly wouldn't be opposed), I simply thought this was a topic worth discussing because I think a lot of people don’t fully realize the effects these comments can have. I think it is worth considering and being aware of. People can choose to agree or disagree and discuss as they please, but these are my thoughts and reasoning. **TL;DR**: Unsolicited fitness advice in a fashion forum, however well intentioned or accurate it may be, is out of place and can have serious consequences on the community. It has not been asked for, it does not contribute to discussion, and it makes MFA a less welcoming and open place for many people. EDIT: We all talk about how fashion is a hobby, not about looking good for other people. Comments appear all the time that are something along the lines of: "Do it for you, dont worry about what others think." But if that were true, body type wouldn't matter. If it were really about the clothes and enjoying clothing and fashion as a passion, who cares what the body looks like? People are allowed to like clothes as a hobby they enjoy and nothing more. 
I was scrolling through a post in FFA and someone literally just copied someone's description of their fashion sense and add 'lol'. It seemed incredibly condescending. It also had over 30 up votes and my question and the OP's question were also down voted. This isn't the first time I have seen this sort of attitude towards 'softer' styles in this subreddit. I know this sort of style is definitely not everyone's style but since when did it become okay to mock someone for different taste? Isn't fashion supposed to be a representation of individual taste and preference? I understand disliking something but surely there are better ways to express that than making fun of someone on the Internet. *EDIT:* I'm sorry about my use of the word feminine, I can see that that would be a gendered word with different connotations to different people. I am not here merely due to one sole comment, this is frustration accumulated over months of certain remarks on FFA. I don't believe in shaming people for their preferences or dismissing styles you don't like. There is a difference between dislike and explaining why versus snarky remarks with no intent other than to shame and that is why I created this thread. 
Wardrobe overhaul! Closet makeover! New year, new you! It seems like every magazine or blog you read these days has published a simple 5- or 10-step process for revamping your style, promising that with a little elbow grease (and a dedicated budget), you too can stop being unfashionable and start being a sophisticated, flawless style icon within the space of a few frenzied weeks. Maybe you’ve tried to do this, or maybe you’re thinking of doing it soon. I’m here to crush your dreams. No, but really: consider this an “IRL” version of the guides you’ve read before. It’s not a revamp, and it’s not an extreme makeover. It’s a mindset (manifesto perhaps) and a set of tools that will help you build or evolve your style over time, while helping you avoid a series of money-wasting identity-crises along the way. Expect this to take 6-12 months, on the shorter end. Sorry to crush those dreams. *** **An Important Note Before We Begin** Consider this cautionary tale, via /u/phantom_poo: &gt; I did a couple wardrobe overhauls, my first was immediately postgrad where I went out and bought a SHIIIITTTTTTTTON of anthropologie business casual and wore all of it like once. Once I started my job it became pretty apparent that a) pencil skirts are not my thing b) I did not lose that last 5 pounds so no, I can't breathe in that dress and c) looking like a twee princess is not normal. So I just went on wearing what I always wore in college, minus ripped jeans and graphic tees. &gt; I think any time I try to use clothes to become someone I'm not, it ends up failing miserably because it's kind of uncomfortable when there's a weird disconnect between how you perceive yourself and what you look like in the mirror. The lesson? Don’t rush a wardrobe overhaul, and don’t lose sight of who you are in the pursuit of being fashionable in some arbitrary way. First of all, exactly what is it you don’t like about your current style? * Has your lifestage changed recently (e.g. graduated from college and started an office job), causing you to feel like your clothes no longer accurately communicate your place in the world? * Has your life*style* changed recently (e.g. moved from Florida to Iowa), causing parts of your wardrobe to be less functional, and revealing gaps between what you have and what you need? * Do you feel like you have a lot of clothes that you don’t particularly like? A lot of clothes that don’t fit you? * Do you just sort of vaguely wish you “dressed better” or “were fashionable” or “knew what clothes would work for you”? You need this guide the most. If you had any trouble answering the above, try [this from Into-Mind. The results you get from that could help you determine which parts of the below you should focus on the most. The steps below are intentionally not in numerical order; you should start at whichever part seems most urgent to you based on why *you* are doing this. There is no universal process for finding a style and creating a wardrobe; we all come into this interest from a different place and for different reasons. *** **Anatomy of an Overhaul** *FIND INSPIRATION*: How do you want to dress? [Here is a guide to using Pinterest that you might find helpful, and [here is a reverse-chronoloigical list of inspiration albums on to get you started thinking about what you like. You might also check out one of our [semi-weekly “What Are You Wearing Today” to see examples of outfits in real life, on a variety of different people. /u/red_raconteur says: &gt; I first went about [overhauling my wardrobe] by stalking FFA for like... a year. Most of my stalking was of WAYWT pics, especially those of the power users (I figured out who those people were earlier on). I also made a Pinterest board where I would pin anything that appealed to me, and then once every few months I would go through and delete images that no longer resonated with me (and I still do this today). I didn't actually get rid of anything or buy anything new for this first year. Instead, I kept a journal of all my outfits and would write down what I thought of them, how they fit, how I felt when I wore them, etc. Once you’ve exhausted yourself pinning inspo images, step away. Come back in a week to re-evaluate. Come back in a month to see if you still like what you identified. It is not unusual at all to find that what you are inspired by has completely changed in a year; once you open your eyes to the influences around, the number of different things that affect your opinion of clothes can be fast and furious. This is normal. And it’s the reason you probably shouldn’t buy a whole new wardrobe right away. /u/ACarNamedScully says: &gt; It took me a long time to figure out my style [...] I like how well-done preppy and "heritage" styles look, but I realized that I don't like wearing them. So I would buy things that don't work with my current wardrobe, and I'm still trying to get rid of some of them. /u/kirmacat says: &gt; The thing that surprised me the most was how much what my friends were wearing made a difference in what I personally wanted to wear. I mean I was "me" with "my style" the whole way through, but I met some people I really liked who were more into streetwear and suddenly there are three pairs of sneakers in my wardrobe because it just made sense. /u/red_raconteur again: &gt; One of the biggest mistakes I made was trying to emulate some of the FFA power users a little too much. I thought their stuff was super cool and so I bought a few items because they fit the other users' aesthetics. While I do still like some of the elements that I admired from those users, I eventually realized that I don't necessarily want to dress just like them. I still sometimes have an issue balancing the inspiration I see with my own personal aesthetic and trying to fit the aspects I like from the inspo into the look I'm trying to achieve. *LEARN ABOUT CLOTHES*: Do you know how clothes should fit? [Here is a explaining how common clothing items in the right size should feel and look. [Here is a guide to explaining how multiple items together in an outfit create a silhouette. [Here is a guide to that will help you understand the different ways clothes will drape, how they will feel and fit, and how to care for them. I know this sounds like the most boring part, and you may be tempted to skip it. Don’t. Knowing this stuff is going to save you a ton of frustration and confusion and “woe is me” feelings along the way, I promise. It’ll make it easier to shop and easier to get advice. Speaking of, our [Simple threads are the perfect place to post or just read for more information on the characteristics of clothes. Things like “will this coat be warmer than this coat?” and “what are some comfortable brands of shoes?” Regularly reading these threads is also a great way to get familiar with styles, brands and stores if you feel like you’re starting from scratch in that area. /u/chadnik says: &gt; [After joining FFA] I got excited about good quality basics, which led me to get excited about details (fabrics, specific hues, quality workmanship, etc.), and resulted in me having a) a far more cohesive wardrobe (instead of one filled with statement items that were impossible to pair up cohesively), b) a 'drobe I felt much more quietly comfortable in (I used to have a lot of '50s-inspired vintage stuff, and swinging over to focus on integrating those pieces with more contemporary things made me realize how literally and figuratively uncomfortable some of those vintage pieces were to wear), and c) what is for me a more creative and interesting way to dress, not feeling beholden to a particular era of style. /u/Scylla_and_Charybdis says: &gt; Of the things I bought last year, there's still a quarter that I ended up reselling and I've found that practicality is really important. There are a lot of things/silhouettes I liked conceptually, but was uncomfortable wearing on myself. What ended up being important was knowing how I liked items of clothing to fit on me (where shoulders fit, where sleeves and hemlines hit, etc.) and it's nice being able to try things on and being able to immediately decide whether it would work or not and think of several things I could wear it with. /u/BronwynMaye says: &gt; The first two years I worked in an office I purchased several pencil skirts. Over that time, I realized that the skirts that felt good all day were all cut in a certain way and made of a certain material. Half way through that second year I tossed a few skirts and archived a skirt suit in the back of my closet because they didn't feel good all day. Then I went out and bought a few more skirts from the brand (and in the material) that felt good. I couldn't have got this decision right unless I took my time identifying exactly what element of the reject skirts were an issue. *LEARN ABOUT YOURSELF*: Knowing what you like in theory is one thing, but actually being able to put it into practice is another. [This guide to dressing for your takes an open-minded and holistic approach to “body type” dressing, explaining how every outfit choice you make has an optical effect on how big/small, short/long, wide/narrow different parts of your body will look. Try some of the options in that guide to see for yourself how an outfit can make your body look different as you adjust different elements of it. [This guide to personal color explains why some colors look better on some people than others, and how to tell if a color harmonizes with your skin tone or not (careful with this one, it can be kind of a rabbit hole). Advice in this area can get a bit prescriptive, depending on who you ask. The important thing is that you understand the characteristics of your body and coloring so that you can use that knowledge to evaluate whether or not you like certain clothes - and, if you don’t like something, to diagnose why. *EXPERIMENT*: Ok, go ahead and shop! Take all that you know about clothes, about yourself, and about your aesthetic direction and buy *one thing*. Maybe two, if you’re feeling spendy. Try it on. Does it fit? Is it comfortable? If not, return it. Buy something else. Try making a few outfits with your new item. Are you able to make a handful of outfits? Great. Are you not? Figure out why: is it because you lack other pieces that are essential for making that item work? Is it because your new item is so far aesthetically afield from what you already own that it doesn't go with anything? If so, you’ll need to decide how much of a priority owning this thing is to you: are you willing to replace all of your jeans and two of your jackets so that this pair of boots won’t look weird? If so, buckle up. If not, just return the boots. It’s not right or wrong to go down either one of those paths, you should just be aware that it’s a choice. The answer for you will have a lot to do with how happy/unhappy you are with your wardrobe as it is right now, and how fast you are comfortable spending money. /u/ACarNamedScully again: &gt; I bought things in colors I don't wear, and I bought some tees that I don't really like the style of (cheap henley tees from Old Navy, why). Luckily, most of my mistakes were inexpensive. It took me a long time to figure out my style though [...] I would recommend against buying everything at once, especially if you're trying to buy "quality" pieces. I would honestly recommend buying less expensive versions of things. It may seem like a waste but I'd rather buy an inexpensive version of something, love it, and buy the expensive version later than buy a lot of expensive things that I regret later. Repeat this process once every few weeks or months, however much your budget and patience can stand. Take note of what’s easy to incorporate in your wardrobe and what’s not. Post in [Outfit Feedback and if you’re not sure if something is working or not. *DON'T RUSH OUT TO THE GOODWILL BIN*: You’ll note that nowhere here have I mentioned purging, that time-tested ritual of emptying out one’s closet and deciding to discard or donate some sizable percentage of it. Although this is a beloved and much-evangelized step in building a wardrobe according to the Internet, I believe it is probably the least important step. Moreover, if you haven’t begun to work on the steps above, you are not in an especially good position to make decisions about what you should purge, and you are very likely to find the process frustrating and riddled with regret. As /u/captainesscrunch describes: &gt; I threw out all of my going out clothes because they didn't fit in with where I wanted to go, and now I have no going out clothes. Every time I'm invited to a party or club I have a crisis because I basically own t-shirts or silk button ups. Keep your club clothes, people. When you understand your style and have a working wardrobe, purging when necessary will become natural to you. Items that don’t make you happy or don’t function well with the rest of your wardrobe will become immediately apparent, and you can decide to sell or donate them based on the amount of space you have available and the amount of sentimentality you feel. You are not a fashion blogger or the subject of a profile piece in Marie Claire (probably). No one is going to think less of you for having a dress in your closet that is aesthetically different from your other dresses. And with that in mind... *** **A Word (Well... Many Words) on “Capsule Wardrobes”** We are living in an era of wardrobe minimalism as a strong and pervasive trend. In the early 2000s, the prevailing trend was 50 Wardrobe Classics That Every Woman Must Own, and now it’s *capsule wardrobes*. A *capsule wardrobe* (I’ll stop italicizing from here out, promise), for the uninitiated, is a small, carefully chosen and perfectly curated set of clothes that all go together - both aesthetically and functionally - and are meant to serve as your sole wardrobe for a given scenario or period of time: a vacation, a semester, a job, a season, a pregnancy, etc. In theory, a capsule wardrobe is meant to give you the widest variety of functional and aesthetically coherent outfit options possible, with the minimum amount of items in your wardrobe. Some sources name an actual number for these items, and some have additional guidelines or blueprints for what constitutes a capsule wardrobe, how many of each item you should include, and how often you should create them. Most present a series of practical steps you can take to get rid of your former disorganized, overflowing closet and replace it with a calm, peaceful and endlessly matchable set of 33 (or whatever number) things. Let’s get one thing straight: wardrobe minimalism is not a virtue in itself. There is no prize for having the fewest items in your wardrobe, no penalty for including 6 colors in your “palette” instead of 5, and to be quite real for a second: **there is no wardrobe philosophy or shopping methodology that is ever going to result in an *end-state*, whereupon you are done choosing and purchasing clothes forever.** /u/lostafarian says: &gt; I definitely don't vibe with the concept of buying "classic pieces that will last a lifetime!" because I don't think that really exists. Case in point: I was obsessed with finding the perfect white t-shirt, and have purchased many different tees over the years that were "classic" (but were actually just trendy at the time) but that I ultimately stopped wearing because the cuts went out of style. Speaking of, here’s /u/Schiaparelli on the role of trends: &gt; I also realized—because I was trying to buy my "basics", like everyday tees and jeans, over several seasons—trends are super pervasive and affect a lot more than you think. Even if you're not buying regularly from fast-fashion places! A lot of things that seem like "classics" get slightly adjusted and changed from season to season, and "wardrobe essentials" also change a lot. Two years ago, casual sneakers probably wouldn't be considered a wardrobe essential—today, a certain kind of sporty, androgynous, casual look has become more normative for womenswear. Two years ago, everyone was supposed to own flats. I owned 5 pairs and hated wearing them all. And now it's incredibly hard to buy tees that don't have a dropped shoulder or raglan sleeve from many retailers, and those are the new "basic" tees. /u/red_raconteur adds: &gt; Sometimes I feel like I should have X number of work outfits and Y number of formal outfits and so on, but there's no formula that says how much of what you actually need. For a little while I freaked out about only owning one blazer but when I actually considered my lifestyle it turns out that one blazer is plenty. Just because other people have more of certain items doesn't mean I need more or am I doing it wrong. It turns out, real life is a lot different than life in a minimalist fashion blog, especially in the following two ways: Number one is that real life contains all sorts of rare or one-time events that cannot be accommodated by a capsule wardrobe: ski trips, weddings, job interviews, moving days and unforeseen illnesses. Your wardrobe needs may be different on the weekends than during the week. You may have a hobby that requires a different dress code than your job. Or you may live somewhere where the weather is extremely hot or cold for two weeks of the year, and temperate the rest of the time. /u/MonocleLewinsky reflects: &gt; What I expected was that I would throw out/get rid of everything that wasn't perfectly curated to my tastes, and wear that for a long time. I didn't account for the external and internal influences that would change what I wanted to wear. Going out with new people with different styles meant that my riding boots didn't make sense at a shady bar where everyone was drinking PBRs in docs. I realized that only siths deal in absolutes, and that my wardrobe will fluctuate with my mood and surroundings and it's ok not to want to pigeonhole myself into the idea of a capsule wardrobe. Instead of overhauling my stock completely, I put away the clothes I'm not as into anymore, just to pull them out months later and find a new perspective on them. Number two is that in real life, just because an outfit combination *can* be made from your capsule wardrobe doesn’t mean it’s an outfit that will work well, or that you’ll even like. Jacket lengths will look incongruous with certain skirt lengths. Shoes will interface poorly with certain pants hems. Shirts will tuck weird into certain waistlines. You should not be approaching your wardrobe from a purely mathematical perspective, thinking that 4 tops x 4 pairs of pants automatically = 16 outfits. Ok, let’s say you still have your heart set on creating a capsule wardrobe. Be aware that you are now playing the game of style in Hard Mode. You will have the highest chances of success with this if you can confidently say the following: * Your aesthetic direction has not changed much recently; you can look back at inspiration images you pinned 6-12 months ago and still feel excited about them. * You know how to judge the fit of your clothes, when to get things tailored and when to just try a different style instead. * You have definite opinions about which silhouettes, inseams, rises, sleeve styles and heel heights look good on you and make you feel comfortable. * You are rarely confused about “how to wear” certain clothing items that interest you. You can create outfits with ease. * You find it easy to look at an outfit on you or someone else, and determine whether it’s working or not, and why. * You have a solid sense of which stores and brands you like, and which items you prefer to buy from each store. You’re comfortable shopping online or in person. You’re able to try things on at one store and dislike them without concluding that a certain type of item NEVER works for you or you can NEVER find a style that you want. * You’re not expecting any major changes in geography, job or weight anytime soon. /u/sister-wendigo describes her capsule wardrobes: &gt; About a year, or year-and-a-half ago I was into Heritage/Kinsfolk-style minimalism but wanted to dabble into streetwear and thought I would eventually want to go full gn. Everything I bought I wanted to be able to intersect all these desires, so I ended up with just a few things that were both quite non-descript and very me. I still have a lot of those things now. When I wanted to buy something, I thought about it a LOT. I remember deciding to buy slide sandals and I already had several outfits in mind by the time I ordered them, and when they finally arrived in the mail they felt so integral in my wardrobe. Thus, it was a "capsule" accidentally. &gt; When I did my S/S 'drobe, I mostly needed A WARDROBE. PERIOD. I had only worked summers at a summer camp so I was sick of trying to make winter stuff work. I was pretty into normcore and into the idea of "play" so i got some vaguely athletic-looking shorts, some t-shirts, white socks, a boxy sheer button down, linen trousers with a drawstring, and muscle tanks. A lot of that stuff was either Madewell or Uniqlo. I didn't go overboard, a lot of it was still mixable, but it was definitely not limited to 5 anymore. This F/W, I abandoned a lot of these "rules" and just fleshed out with bolder pieces and accessories, though I was way more comfortable taking bigger and spendier risks. Nodding your head vigorously at the above? Great. Here’s the reigning authority on capsule wardrobes. Go nuts. If that bulleted list was overwhelming and wendigo’s quote made you kind of terrified, try... *** **30x30, a Minimalism Experiment** Every few months in FFA, we do a [30x30 Remix inspired by the challenges [Kendi used to host a few years back. For 30 days, you choose 30 items in your wardrobe, and try to wear only those (hopefully in a collection of 30 different outfits). This is a great way to try minimalism on for size, experiment with creating outfits, identify the gaps between your wardrobe and your lifestyle, and get feedback (either from others or through self-reflection) on where your style is headed. One optional but interesting feature of the 30x30 is that traditionally, you don’t buy clothes during it. This can be a great way of putting the brakes on the overhaul you’re so tempted to do RIGHT THIS SECOND, in order to get a better handle on the knowledge and skills you really need in order to build a better wardrobe in the long term. It can be a lot of effort, yes. But that’s the point. Finding a style and building a wardrobe is an iterative process. Despite what the Internet may have led you to believe, you cannot cocoon yourself deeply into Pinterest for a weekend and emerge a fully formed, fashionable butterfly first thing Monday morning. This process takes years - sometimes a lifetime - and the point is not to finish, but to enjoy the experience along the way. /u/Schiaparelli again: &gt; Partly because I'm still a student (and only make money during summers, which I have to budget during the school year) and partly because my taste is constantly changing, I buy very slowly. I think it took two years since I first found FFA and started getting serious about my personal style to feel like I had a wardrobe for all seasons that I was very comfortable and confident in. I know that sounds terrible—two years!—but I was also figuring out what I liked and disliked, and learning a lot about fashion as a social/cultural/commercial force, and so the journey was really fun to me, even though my wardrobe changed slowly. *With acknowledgment and thanks to the many FFAers who contributed their thoughts on this subject, including all of those quoted above as well as /u/koko_bean and /u/mellownyellow for their overall editorial input. There is such a wealth of experience in this community, and I’m excited to have been able to bring so many specific anecdotes and tips to the forefront to illustrate the spirit of this guide.* 
[Comparison This morning I got on the scale and it read 153lbs. I am a F/5'6"/36yo. My BMI was 24.69. For the first time in at least 15 years, I am no longer considered to be overweight. I still have 10lbs to go before I hit my goal, but so far so good. You can read more about my story/plan from an earlier post I made Basically, I ate less (initially used MFP to track calories, but haven't done this regularly in a while). Mostly lean protein and veggies, but no specific diet and no foods are "forbidden". Started with a C25K program and am now doing some interval training on my treadmill, logging in about 12 miles/week. I feel amazing. Thanks to everyone on this subreddit, you are all the best!!! ***edited to say "DERP". I guess this is technically a SV. I was thinking of it as a categorical shift and not a number goal met. Of course it is based on the number on the scale. Either way it feels awesome!! ***Second edit to give a shout out to all my sisters from I have had such fun on that subreddit learning how to properly attire my new body. I have learned more about health and style in the past six months than in the last twenty years. 
I frequent /r/femalefashionadvice and one of my favorite discussions they do there occasionally are ["Change my threads. The basic premise is that people will post opinions they have on fashion or style, and responders will post counterexamples to change their viewpoint. For example, someone may post "Sneakers are inappropriate in every outfit but workout gear," and responders would provide links to photographs of outfits that they feel incorporate sneakers into a non-workout outfit, or an explanation of how they could be made to work. [Here's another of a Change my View thread, although this one is more text heavy. Since the focus of this sub is makeup, which is a visual art, I think responses that contain images of the counterexamples you're describing work best. I've found CMV thread to be a fantastic source of inspiration and and a way to get out of style ruts I get stuck in. Does anyone else want to try one with makeup? To prevent this from devolving into anarchy, we need to remember to stay civil. If someone posts an opinion that's different than yours, don't get upset! They're posting here because they want someone to change their mind! Think of it as an opportunity, not an insult. **DO NOT DOWNVOTE IN DISAGREEMENT**, and try not to respond with "oh my god yes I agree with this so much." If you do agree, try to provide some reasons. Otherwise, try to change people's minds. Be polite and detailed. This discussion only works if we stay civil. Ready, go.

It's really hard to write this without sounding/feeling like a creepy stalker who stares at your chests all day, but as a woman who's been in badly fitting bras, I identify bad bras pretty easily now that I'm in a properly sized one. I've been lurking this sub for about a month or less now -- someone dropped by a sub I frequent and said she was referred to us by someone here. And since I'm basically illerate in the language of fashion, I figured I'd subscribe and see what I could learn (which has been great, by the way! I've started noticing WHAT seems off now with certain outfits rather than just "feeling" like something is off). In the process, I've noticed that many here aren't in bras that fit right. A fitting bra is more than just a number and a letter. It affects your breast health, posture, and even how well your bust fits and looks in clothes. As a quick example, [here is a great visual of how a badly fitting band as well as a proper one affects how your breasts I've also seen women who appear to be DD+ saying they're in C cups or smaller (with enormous band sizes!). Since there's always a bit of a misconception of "cup size" among those of us who have been in a wrong size for far too long (Victoria's Secret consistently sized me at a 34C -- I'm a 28FF!), please know that a [DD is not as big as you think it and that measuring breasts by cup alone is incorrect. Cup size is nothing without band size. This is why the logic of throwing women into bigger bands to get bigger cups is *so wrong*. I think the biggest thing we see over at /r/abrathatfits are new measures that go "I can't be an FF!" or "I can't be a DD!" This goes back to bust and band sizes. Just as you go up in a band size, the cups sizes of a bra go up. [Here is a great illustrating how band and bust size correlates.

**Introduction** There are six elements of art—one of which is color. As fashion is a way of creative expression like any forms of art, we can apply the various elements and principles of art to come up with a coherent, aesthetically pleasing outfit. Color is overlooked by many people when it comes to dressing themselves, often opting to go for safe neutrals instead. Some out of fear but mostly because of unfamiliarity, which is what this guide aims to change because when used well color can be one of the best ways to make your outfits stand out. **The Color Wheel** To understand color matching we must familiarize ourselves with the basic color wheel, shown You can generally reduce any strangely named color to the 12 basic ones in the color wheel. Colors like crimson, goldenrod and ultramarine are pretty much just red, yellow and blue. Another thing to note about color is the temperature of each. We can classify colors into either being warm or cool. Warm colors have golden undertones while cool ones have blue undertones. The easiest way to understand this is to think of warm colors as colors that evoke sunshine and heat and cool colors are those that impart a sense of calmness and iciness. This is especially important in the context of fashion because we have to take into consideration our skin tones when dressing. Generally speaking if you have a warm-tone skin color you will look best in warm colors and vice-versa. Here are the and colors in the color wheel. **Color Harmonies** Now comes the fun part. In color theory there are a great deal of color harmonies but we will focus on just five basic ones: monochromatic, complementary, analogous, triadic and split-complementary. 1.	Monochromatic Coming from the root words mono, meaning one and chroma, meaning color, monochromatic color schemes are made up of shades of just one base color. Some samples A color scheme of burgundy, salmon and cherry red is a monochromatic scheme. Contrary to popular belief monochromatic does not automatically mean or [black and Technically speaking wearing various grays and blacks is monochrome but the term does not exclusively refer to just those colors. A better term for black and white color schemes would be achromatic, literally meaning without color. 2.	Complementary Complementary colors are colors that are directly across each other in the color wheel. There are six complementary colors in the wheel. This dual scheme is very appealing to the eye and is often used in movies, like in (red and green) and (blue and orange). Some outfit samples A caveat: complementary color schemes can be too harsh or bright for some. A good way to try a complementary color combo without seeming too loud is to wear a muted shade of one or both colors, like in red/green outfit. She tempered the fire engine red of her dress with the subdued olive cardigan. In other example the colors in the outfit are both muted shades of blue and orange, making for a striking combination without looking comical. 3.	Analogous Analogous colors are three colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. It is often confused with monochromatic schemes. Usually there is just one dominant color while the others are used as accents. Samples Analogous color schemes are easy, safe and reliable combos but using various tones of each color gives [a nuanced, sophisticated 4.	Triadic A triadic color scheme uses three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. Triadic color schemes look very vibrant. A classic example would be your primary color scheme of red, blue and yellow, as seen in outfit. In another example, outfit utilizes a triadic scheme of orange, violet and yellow. Again, if this seems too bright for you, you can opt for muted shades of triadic color schemes to make it more wearable, like in one (red/blue/yellow). 5.	Split-Complementary The split-complementary color scheme is a variation of the complementary color scheme. You take one color, look into its complementary color and take the two colors beside it, as shown in diagram. This is a rather unusual way of combining colors and while it’s tricky, the impact is worth it if you get it right. Samples **Neutrals** When talking about color in the context of fashion we cannot forget neutrals. Neutrals often make up the bulk of our wardrobes and some are content with dressing exclusively in neutrals. Think of neutrals as foolproof colors that can be paired with most anything. Common neutrals in fashion are black, white, navy, gray and brown along with the innumerable shades of each. Less common ones are olive, taupe and some very dark and muted shades of plum. Do take note that this is not a definitive list of neutrals. **Putting it All Together** It seems daunting given all this information, but it’s easier once you realize that there are basic guidelines underlying every color combination. In example we see 2/3 of a triadic color scheme (green/violet/orange without the orange). In an extremely muted primary color combination. outfit may seem like a bunch of things chosen haphazardly, but it actually has two color schemes going on: a complementary one of blue and orange and an analogous palette of blues and greens. An easy way to wear color would be to pair a bright hue with one or more neutrals, as seen in these examples (violet with black and gray) (aqua blue with white and black) (red and black) [4] (bright mustard with navy and black) (tangerine with black and nude). The neutral/s will temper the vividness of the bright hue, making it easier to pull off colors if you’re not used to them. Another way to utilize neutrals would be to use neutral colored accessories if you’re wearing a colorful outfit, like in example. The black accessories provide a nice edge and contrast to her otherwise pastel sweet monochromatic mint green outfit. Pairing neutrals with any of the aforementioned color harmonies gives coherence to your outfit. In example we see an analogous scheme of blues and greens paired with black. In a complementary combo of red/green with black and white. Using color as an is one way to ease your way into wearing color especially if you’ve grown used to wearing neutrals all the time. If you’re wearing an all-neutral outfit, throwing in a well chosen in an accent color can give new life to your usual coordinates. **Conclusion** It’s important to remember that there are thousands of possible colors and correspondingly, thousands of possible color combinations that this guide is merely an introduction. Look around and you’ll see all sorts of unexpected color palettes. can serve as your best Part of developing your eye is making mistakes and learning from ridiculous color combos. Master the basics and then experiment. Use the info here as a rough guide, not some sort of set in stone rulebook and try not to adhere to old fashioned views like not pairing navy with black because that will just hold you back. Have fun! 
Since we’re a fashion subreddit a lot of the discussions here touch on body image, body type and size. One specific topic that has come around every once in a while is how to adapt certain styles for your body. It's a valid question, so /u/ikeamonkeycoat and I wrote this post and gathered the inspo album in the hope that it inspires everyone to experiment with the styles they like. Especially because most fashion inspo you find on Pinterest tends to feature bloggers that are a. very tall and very lean, or b. plus sized (not that there aren’t a lot of ‘in between’ bloggers, but more on that later) it can be hard to visualize how a new style will look on your body when you have big boobs and a big butt. A lot of typical body type clothing guides encourage people with hourglass bodies to wear form-fitting clothing that emphasizes the waist. HOWEVER, this doesn’t mean you can’t wear different silhouettes (e.g. loose-loose, drapey fits); it only means that getting other silhouettes to work requires a bit more effort and attention to detail than you are probably used to. Now regarding inspo from bloggers: I understand that especially when you’re trying something new, it’s nice to be able to copy an outfit and be sure that it’ll look as great on you as it does in the inspo picture. This approach has some pitfalls though: * First of all, even if a blogger has the same weight and measurements as you do, it does not mean that her body looks the same as yours. After all, things like proportion and fat distribution play a role so the exact same clothes will probably still not look the same on you. * Secondly, a blogger with the same weight and measurements might not have the same goals with dressing as you do: you might be self conscious about different aspects of your body so you’d want to emphasize/de-emphasize different things. * Lastly, odds are that when you find you perfect body double/style blogger you won’t be able to copy the outfits one-on-one because of availability/affordableness of the items. There is no shortcut to understanding what works for your body. The best way to learn how to adapt a certain style to your needs is to get out there, try stuff on, take pictures and evaluate. NOW FOR SOME INSPO: I’ve included several people with an hourglass figure/big boobs/big butt wearing a variety of clothing. In some cases I show the same people wearing different silhouettes and I hope this illustrates that your body shape is compatible with any clothes you like, as long as you put in the time and effort to find clothes that fit *YOU* well. [Here's a song to get you in the [HERE'S THE ALBUM, EDIT: THANKS FOR THE GOLD WHOEVER YOU ARE &lt;3 
Hello everyone :) I'll keep it short and sweet. (I failed, sorry.) I've been on the overweight side of life my whole life. Because of this, my whole wardrobe used to be almost exclusively black (because slimming effects. Also, mad at the world). I had a cohesive look by virtue of only wearing one colour, not by choice, but out of necessity, really. My favourite colour is actually white, go figure. I've since lost some weight, and I can now wear so many cuts and colours that I felt like I couldn't before. It's gurrrrrrreat! I generally wear neutral clothes, and then play with colour in purses or shoes (this week all I wore was my fave white pumps though). HOWEVER, as I battle the Last Ten Pounds (grrrrr), I find I miss cohesion, and I miss having a "look". I feel a little bit all over the place, and the shopping is just out of control. This link is to an album of a week's worth of outfits, for your perusalz. I apologize for looking away so much, Boyf took pics and was making me blush :) so I couldn't focus on my pose game smh. Also I hope these are clear - the wall on my balcony is the whitest thing in life. I'd like some help (a) refining my style to fit words like [feminine (not girly, though), elegant, adult, chic, BUT ALSO relaxed, effortless]. All tips, comments, critique welcome! Blunt is better with me :) (b) some inspo - blogs, pinners, whatever - to help me kind of rein it in. I'm basically going for **I WOKE UP LIKE DIS - FLAWLESS** because #lifegoals .

Hey, girls. I, like many of you, love Modcloth. However, it is no secret that many of their products can be found elsewhere for less... except they don't list their brands. So I've made it my mission to make as comprehensive of a list as possible. This is mostly for their apparel, but if you have any other product brands, feel free to list! Grab your Modcloth buys and read those labels! Here is the list I have so far: * Bettie Page * Lindy Bop * Tulle * Petrunia * Eyekepper * Pinup Couture (possibly?) * Folter Clothing * Myrtlewood and Bea and Dot (their exclusive brand) * Hell Bunny * Heartbreaker (now Heart of Haute) * Stop Staring * T.A.G * Dear Creatures * Blutsgeschwister * Sunny Girl * Retrolicious * Yumi * Cache Cache * Rock Steady * Sessun * Taylor Shoes * Qupid * Jeffrey Campbell * Seychelles * Bamboo * Restricted * Wild Diva Lounge * T.U.K * Red Circle * Pleaser (possibly?) * Irregular Choice * Betsey Johnson * Chase &amp; Chloe Home * Roy G. Baker 
I secretly love those [what your favorite x says about posts and I thought it would be kind of fun to do it here for various brands. To keep things organized, post only the name of a brand/store as a top level thread and then respond to that comment. Lastly, remember that these comments are not meant to be a personal attack on anyone and you can shop where you like. (Most people will be making fun of brands they shop at.) Consider this more of a light hearted critique of a brand's image and the consumer base they actively market to. (Also, you might be better served to focus on making comments about brands you actually shop at.)

There are probably quite a few of you who secretly love Modcloth and twee fashion in general. I mean really, the clothes are undeniably cute, unique, and interesting to look at. I know for some of you, twee is completely out of the question. That’s perfectly fine! It’s definitely not for everyone. I wrote this guide to Modcloth, for those of you who love twee. I hope you guys find it useful! *I should mention this guide is more on "How to do Modcloth right" I've touched on twee because it is used in a lot of Modcloth fashion. **Should I buy it on Modcloth?** The prices on Modcloth have a large range. There are plenty of affordable items—especially if you check out their sale section or wait for their clearance sales. Sometimes they mark their items up a good $10-$15 more than other stores. Of course, you aren’t going to be able to find *all* of Modcloth’s items in other stores. (They'll also do $15 off your first purchase if someone referred you. Message me if you want a referral, I'll get the $15 too) Here are some stores that have similar stuff: * * [Ruche]( * [Spotted Moth]( * [Asos]( * [UrbanOG]( (mostly their shoes) I could have made this list longer to include a few other stores, but the more I looked through them, the more they started to look like forever 21. These stores have a more defined style. **Some reasons people love MC** 1. The customer reviews + product descriptions: They have a cult-like customer base. People are enthusiastic about the store. They write a lot of reviews; they post a lot of pictures. The product descriptions tell you what the items are made of, whether it runs large or small, and whether or not the fabrics provide stretch. 2.They have very good customer service: They have an instant chat service that you can talk to their representatives to get their advice or ask questions about how things fit. Within the US, shipping is free over $50, and returns are always 100% free. You just print out the return label and you can even give your package to your USPS mail carrier. 3. It's really easy to sort through their clothes by size, color, key words, styles, lengths. It’s like shopstyle, but built into the site. 4. There's a huge plus sized selection of clothing that actually looks like the regular sized clothes. They also have dresses in longer lengths for you tall ladies. **Some reasons people don’t:** 1. The price 2. Clothing is too cutesy/twee; not to their aesthetic taste 3. MC’s diversity of brands means not everything is going to be the same quality. Prices don’t seem to correlate to quality. Sometimes expensive items are cheaply made, sometimes they’re not. It’s hard to tell just by looking at pictures. (easy, free returns and reviews help with this one) 4. A lot of the time, they don't tell you what the brand of the clothes are. I can't blame them though, they are a business after all. Again, you could always order it and return it if you find it cheaper. Or chat with their reps. My opinion is that if you really like something, just order it and see. The returns are free. **If so many people like MC, why is it frowned upon here on FFA?** 1. It comes back to the quality of clothing. Sometimes, it’s just not worth the price. There are other places you can get better quality things for less. 2. MC is over the top with their cutesy promoting and presentation. It’s to the point of being sickeningly sweet and annoying 3. People overdo it. Plain and simple: people wear too much stuff while trying to accessorize and be different. **What do you mean “overdo it?” am I overdoing it?** Modcloth loves to post style lookbooks. Upon first glance, you might think they're well put together and cohesive. The longer you look, the easier it will be to see that *holy shit, could she BE wearing any more clothes?!* Obviously, people in the real world don’t normally dress this way. MC is a business and businesses will try to sell their products. The more products their models are wearing: the more products gain visibility. You are not a Modcloth model. You did just not step out of a lookbook. You can wear almost anything overly cute or bold, but when you start pairing it with other things to match it, that’s when it’s going to be too much. It’s going to look like you tried really hard to put your look together. It will look forced. **“Modcloth done wrong” In depth reasons and descriptions found in the album. **Comparisons before we move on** [Striped color On the left: The dress pattern and the cardigan have too much visual stimulation. The bow on top of that puts the outfit over the top. The shoes are also very heavy looking. I would generally recommend against wearing a shirt under a dress if you can, especially if the dress has a pattern on it (or if it’s heavily textured or colored) On the right: replace the dress with some simple dark jeans and she looks that much neater. The cardigan stands alone as the focal point of the outfit. The polka dotted tights/socks are unnecessary. [Striped primary colors On the left: The dress is a bold statement on its own. She pairs it with a neutral heel and her outfit is simple. It fits well and she looks effortlessly put together, with only one item of clothing on. On the right: She matches the headband, her tights, and her shoes to the dress. The colors are overwhelming, especially the yellow tights. The dress might look a little bit young by itself, but if you wear it right, it **can** look age appropriate. **More examples of how to do MC right please!** [Inspiration album I put **Key notes:** -One or two non-neutral colors per outfit [refer -Unique items in neutral colors are easily paired into other outfits without looking costumey [refer -If you choose a brightly colored or heavily patterned article, let it stand on its own for attention [refer - Patterns can be mixed more successfully when they are in the same color family [refer -You don’t need to match everything with everything [refer Thanks for reading! Questions and comments are appreciated. I'll be editing as we go along :) **EDIT** I am not judging anyone who wishes to dress twee to the fullest extent. The guide is for the number of you who do like elements of twee, but *can't* go all out. For how to make that one special item you had to have but couldn't figure out how to work it into everyday wear. I definitely AM a person who loves the overly cute things, but being practical: it doesn't work all the time. One of the biggest things about fashion and getting it right is knowing when which outfits are appropriate. If you want to wear knee highs, go for it. If you want to carry a handbag shaped like a kitten riding a roomba, go for it. If you want to match all of your items to your other items, go ahead and do it. This is a guide! Not an instruction manual. You just do you. &lt;3 **EDIT2** Thank you guys for the support and comments. I may not have replied to everyone, but I did give you guys upvotes. :) 
Hello FFA! I actually posted this album a couple weeks ago on [this]( thread and was excited to receive such positive feedback. I’ve since added new photos as promised, including some suggestions for more monochromatic and fits. To summarize, this is an album of men and women wearing very similar outfits placed side by side for comparison. I tried to find fits that not only had the same colour palette, but the same clothing cut/style as well. Most images were taken from Pinterest - I just pinned outfits that I thought would transfer well to the opposite gender and started matching. Some resemblances are better than others, but I think the individual touches are what make some fits more characteristically masculine or feminine. This is definitely not a typical androgynous “menswear” inspo album, but I hope you find it interesting! [ALBUM 
Here it is: Each image is a montage of a type of clothing e.g. shirt, pants, etc. I love taking risks and there are a few items I am unsure of so I wanted to document my wardrobe for CC. But in the process I had discovered some unexpected benefits. **1. It allowed me to let a lot pieces go easily.** It gave me perspective about how things look on me and while I had some items that looked good I didn't want them getting in the way of things that looked great. **2. It made me fall in love with things all over again.** My commute takes me through an inexpensive mall and and I have been purchasing a lot of fast fashion lately. Shinny and new was getting in the way of things I love and had forgotten about. **3. My room has never been cleaner.** No more trying a million things on. I just look at the images and grab what I'm feeling. **4. I finally figured out what my style is.** I know my strengths and what think I need to take it to the next level. I can't recommend doing this enough! 
*Hi! I posted this over at mfa, and a few women suggested you might also enjoy it. It's obviously designed for me as a dude, but the template I provide is completely gender neutral and could easily be used by either sex. I have to get back to work, so I'm just going to copy and paste the original post. Hope it helps!* I'm pretty new here, and I'm trying to build a wardrobe basically from the ground up. I've found (and been tempted to ask myself) numerous questions about what people should be prioritizing if they're just starting out. I think I can help with that. Whenever I get a new hobby, I typically build a spreadsheet for it. And this one is no different. So /r/**fe**malefashionadvice, I present to you my [Wardrobe Assessment It's a lot of information, so let me break it down for you. **PURPOSE** My biggest problem is I felt overwhelmed by choice. I needed so many things, but I didn't have good stock of what I already had or how my current items should fit into my wardrobe. This spreadsheet allowed me to catalog the things I have along with the things I still need to let me prioritize my next purchases. There are certain things I need but just don't like buying (eg khaki pants). There are certain things I have but love buying (eg black overcoats). I needed a way to assess my needs along with my wants and to compare unlike purchases so I could help order them from most to least important. **CATEGORIES** I started by subdividing into categories, splitting item types and formality of the items. This helps me compare like to like. It's useless to know I have four black sweaters, if I won't wear any of them to work. **CRITERIA** I created several criteria to rate the items I have, which creates the overall rating, helping to determine my purchases. The higher the overall rating (column H), the more I need to buy something of that type. *# Inventory* - This is just the amount of something I have currently. *# Desired* - The amount I feel I'll need to fill out my wardrobe. *Importance* - The importance of an item to my wardrobe. Some things match with a bunch. Some are more for specific situations. Also for me, work always takes priority over casual. *Satisfaction* - How happy am I with the items I have? Sure, I HAVE black dress shoes. But I don't like them very much. This category allows that to factor in as I consider my needs. *Desire* - How much do I *want* a specific item. Some things I just think are really cool, so I value them more. This lets me filter some of my subjective desire into my objective rating. *Affordability* - How much will it cost me to acquire an item? It's EASY to get new socks, so let's knock that out first. Factoring in how affordable something is makes the purchase easier on me. The higher the affordability rating, the cheaper the item. *Rating* - This is a formula that combines the other scores. I'll break this down in the comments so non-math folks won't have to read it, and hopefully y'all can keep it near the top. Just know all inputs are factored. *Prospective buy* - Something I can afford and think looks nice. Most of these are empty, but you can see in the black overcoat row how this box would work. *Coolest I've seen* - Grail items so to speak, the very best of an item so I can compare things in my price range. **WOW, NERD, DO YOU FOLLOW THIS SPREADSHEET EXACTLY?** Hell no. You can see black overcoat doesn't rank very high, but I just bought one yesterday. Still, it's helpful to assessing holes. I didn't realize how bad I needed blue jeans. Now I do. It's just a tool. I also bought some red socks today, because I think they can add a lot of versatility for cheap, which the rating sheet confirmed. **HEY! I CAN'T EVEN EDIT THIS!** Sorry, I can't let you edit mine, but I will help you create your own. **MY VERY OWN?!** Yep. [Here's a template I made just for Sign in with your own google account, then go to "File" and select "Make a Copy". Now you've got your very own. You can see I've left you ten categories and ten items in each to play with. **WAIT, HOW DO I...** Ok, honestly, I'm getting insecure putting this much work into this when I'm not sure anyone will use it. I don't want to get too in-depth, if I'm wasting my breath. I went back and forth when making it . . . "I bet some of the guys at mfa will love this" "No, you idiot, you're the only dweeb who loves spreadsheets. Fashion is art, not math" I'm happy to answer any individual questions, and if there is interest, I'll make a user guide to help you tailor (haha hahahaha hahahahahaha) the spreadsheet to your own needs. Hope this helps at least one other person! **EDIT: ALL RATINGS ARE OUT OF FIVE.** Sorry, I should have included that. Keeping the ratings out of five makes the inventory numbers properly impactful. Expanding to ten would undo that, without adding some scaling. **EDIT 2: MY GOD, IT SEEMS LIKE THE CONDITIONAL FORMATTING DIDN'T CARRY OVER TO THE TEMPLATE. I hope y'all didn't think I colored every cell by hand. It should be fixed now, so that the cells all color automatically. Hopefully someone can test that out, and let me know if it works. If you already made a copy, you may want to make a new one to get the conditional formatting. That's what makes it so pretty.** 
I have compiled most of the photos posted in the Post &amp; Request Inspiration Thread since I began posting it in late March since I noticed recent threads were receiving more duplicate requests; I thought this might help anyone using Reddit search for inspiration. They are sorted roughly by the number of points the post itself received (roughly -- this seemed to change each time I visited the post, even just refreshing the page).

**Let’s talk Native, y’all.** First, I’ll probably be using the terms Native, Native American, Indian, American Indian, and NDN interchangeably throughout this post. Lots of people have feelings about these terms, but none of them are consistent across Indian Country. There’s another term! When Native peoples in the US refer to pan-continental groups of Natives in the US, we usually use the term Indian Country to do so. Here I will not be touching on anything south of the US, and will only sort of be including First Nations people (Canadian Natives), since I don’t know them that well. As for myself, I am a citizen of a very small, state recognized Native Nation in the Southeastern United States. I’d rather not say which, because it would be too easy to track me down via my other Reddit interests if someone really cared to do so. Needless to say, all Native groups in the US aren’t the same, so I’m just not going to know things about other regions of the US. That’s okay! Indian Country isn't homogenous, guys. Different fashion, different hairstyles, different dances. It’s not all the same. If someone sees an issue or error, let me know. I ain’t here to hurt feelings. I’m influenced a bit by powwow culture as well, which some other Natives will not relate to. _______ **Moving on to the pretties** Okay, guys. Fashion is really shitting the bed with Native influences. [High fashion [hipster Urban Outfitter “Navajo” panties, calling everything “Navajo” or “Cherokee”. Not only that, it’s just boring as all get out. Hey, let’s glue some feathers on. What about some conchos? Maybe we should put more leather fringe on this jacket. Seriously guys, I think the only Native info some fashion people have is from watching Disney Pocahontas. Blogs like [Native and [Beyond have done a great job calling out the bullshit, but often they just get defensive denials from appropriators. Except [Paul who gets all the brownie points for admitting mistakes and taking huge strides by creating collaborations with Native designers. And then [Patricia almost won [Project what what! But what is an admiring fashionista to do? Anyone who has held out on jumping on the Native train gets mad props from me. It was the right thing to do, because many prints, motifs, and materials hold sacred meaning to different Native peoples. Guess what you get in return? Sweet links to high quality, Native-designed fashions that will last way longer and look way more awesome than a crappy printed tee from F21. There are two major resources you should know about. First is the literal holy grail of Native fashion, the [Beyond Buckskin Every day, I want to spend every dollar there. It is run by a Native fashion blogger and features only Native artists. Maybe most importantly, they have awesome clothing and accessories at every price point. You can wear anything in there with pride. That being said, make sure you don’t look like you’re wearing a costume. Second, and this is a bit more controversial, is the Oregon wool company There is a contingent in Indian Country that believes Pendleton takes advantage of their collaborations with Native peoples. I disagree. I think a great symbiotic relationship is evident in here. Beyond that, it's a great entry point for people daunted by trying to learn okay and off-limits prints. In the past, when a person was honored, in Plains tribes they would often be given a bison pelt robe as a sign of honor. It made you a kind of leader with the attendant responsibilities. That tradition has since bled into other regions. Certain Pendleton blankets have taken the place of bison robes within Native groups and at powwows. Pendleton explicitly produces some prints to engage with this need. Pendleton has a vested interest in not being dicks and producing prints that would offend tribes. You’ll see all kinds of Native designers using Pendleton prints and wool in their gear. Bottom line for you: if the print in a garment is being produced by Pendleton, you’re pretty good to go. On that note, you can even buy remanents or bolts from Pendleton and make your own awesome stuff. Go for it if you’ve got the sewing bug. A note of caution on Etsy: Don’t buy from an Etsy seller unless you’re pretty sure they are Native. They should have a little note on their store that says “I’m native and in compliance with the Native arts act (whatever it’s called)”. I’ve added a bunch of stores you can peruse down in the comments below. Some don’t have this note, but I still think they are probably Native storefronts. Buy from those people with this in mind. ______ *Offensive things (ie CODE RED):* Eagle feathers (also will get you arrested, yo) Fake eagle feathers Hawk feathers (will also get you arrested, yo) [Whole wing Whole turtle shells (don’t DO THIS) [Any wing feathers sticking straight up off of your [Redskins Clev Indians gear [Broken pottery used as Drums with primary color paint triangles on the sides [Paper headdresses on kids at Sacred imagery or patterns [Clan or family owned imagery [Tattoos of white women in warpaint and war ______ *Not Native fashion (ie YELLOW LIGHT, bro):* [Hemp Random, unaltered shells hanging off things [Limp cheap [Cheap dyed [Cheap beaded “Native” shit from other [Things from Etsy labeled [Weird tiny feathers tied into your hair with leather thong and plastic Maxi full skirts with flower prints [Minnetonka Leather thong bracelets with pony beads _________ *That’s cool, but YMMV (GREEN LIGHT):* Generic motifs like repeating bands of squares Things you buy from Native designers [Feathers used in other (English, French, whatevs) [Cedar Quillwork Beadwork (from the Americas) Certain types of shellwork Turquoise jewelry Silver jewelry Copper jewelry Moccasins without stupid pre-sewn eagle sketches Fingerwoven belts Concho belts Macaw feather earrings Leather Leather fringe Other fringe Patchwork Parfleche (if newly made and purchased) Mirrors Wampum (if worn tastefully) and Quahog shell Headbands (iffy on this one, but go for it if you’re feeling it) Ribbons _________ **On to the Inspo Album!** It’s arranged loosely, from more colorful to less colorful and from grassroots to high fashion, generally. I’ve added some awesome historical inspiration as well, hopefully that will go over alright. Finally, I have to say again that I don’t speak for all of Indian Country and I only know the things I know. If anyone has questions or concerns, let me know! EDIT: I'm going to go through and add photo examples of all the things I listed to help with understanding! 
Last week I mentioned that I could share an album on Iranian street fashion and after many of you shared enthusiasm I managed to get permission from a style blog to share some photos of how some young Iranians are styling themselves. To give some background, in 1979 Iran experienced a revolution that brought an end to centuries of monarchy and established an Islamic Republic. The newly formed Islamic Republic, heavily under the influence of the clergy, ushered huge social changes and started a campaign to uproot Western influence in Iranian culture. The [Cultural closed down the universities for years while it purged the institutions of people it considered against the revolution, banned certain books and music and the consumption of pork and alcohol, and influenced Iranian fashion by making the covering of the hair and body mandatory for women over 9, as well as taking a stance against make-up, nail polish, bright colors, and high heels. The revolution was less proscriptive for men but, for example, [discouraged them from certain hair Men also stopped wearing ties (tragic), which were seen as too Western. Dress codes were and still are monitored by revolutionary guards and so-called morality police, which fined and arrested people (and still do) for violations. Over the years Iranian people [adapted to their new dress as well as found ways to push the boundaries. As the new regime settled in over the years it became seemingly less adamant about enforcing its dress code as strictly as it had just after the revolution. In Tehran, especially in the Northern boroughs where the upper middle class and chic upper class live, coats started getting shorter and tighter, sleeves were rolled higher, pant hems went up and scarves scooted farther and farther back on bigger hair. Iranians started making underground businesses out of importing fashion from Europe, Turkey, China and the States. Today many people [operate out of their and word spreads by mouth. The restrictions on showing many parts of the body made people play up the parts of their body they *could* show, by applying heavy make-up, getting showy hairstyles and manicures, becoming obsessed with nosejobs, and overall starting to look a little ridiculous (a style that carried with them as they migrated to places like LA). Today Iranians, especially those in larger cities like Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz and the like, are as committed to fashion as they ever were. When I visited in the winter of 2008/2009, the shoe boutiques in Tehran put the ones in my California city to shame. But of course, due to trade restrictions, knock-offs and horrendous mark-ups (F21 shirts for $90, anyone?) were also rampant. The street style that is shown in this album is not representative of how most people in Iran dress, but are instead "Tumblr" examples from a group of fashion focused people. Most of the photographs are from Tehran, although a couple are in Isfahan and Shiraz. I must give thanks to The Tehran Times for giving me permission to share these photos, and I hope you guys enjoy.

They've got some pretty tech-savvy venture capital funding and have been reportedly spamming review sites with paid reviews, so I wouldn't be surprised if this gets buried by bots in a few minutes. But I figured I'd try to warn you all anyway... Their business model is essentially a classic bait and switch scam: Everything looks great [on this right? Cheap boots and a VIP Membership just for purchasing them!? Every other pair of shoes on the site will only be $39.95!? Sounds awesome! [Their all but confirms that that's the deal: All shoes $39.95, right? **WRONG!!** What they've cleverly hidden below the visible area of the checkout page is the fact that you're actually just signing up for another monthly shoe club. See Still haven't noticed the subscription you're agreeing to? You're not the only one. This is what's known as a "dark pattern" in web design: A user interface that's carefully crafted to trick users into doing things they may not want to do. In fact, what they're doing in the U.S. is actually **illegal** in Germany thanks to their consumer protection laws. Notice how their checkout page is split into two options, one that signs you up for the subscription and one that just lets you buy the single pair of shoes you wanted: They were the target of a class action lawsuit in the U.S. (even though their Terms of Service try to make you waive that right). The suit can be found along with a lot of comments from people who fell for their trick. For example: *"I have been repeatedly trying to cancel my membership with for 5 months. Every time I call the customer service rep continues to try and diswade [sic] my request to the point of 10 full minutes at which point I always tell them “JUST CANCEL MY MEMBERSHIP” and hang up. I believe they are paid commission on every call they take that results in a hang up. I’ve emailed repeatedly and they just won’t cancel and continue to bill me. I am putting a complaint through my credit card and I am hoping this will stop these illegal business practices."* And here is a Reddit thread from a month ago where several people were similarly tricked and/or had a difficult time canceling: And Whether you like their business model or not, people should at least be aware of what they're signing up for when they shop there.

Since wedding season is upon us again, I thought I'd take a moment to compile (and also solicit) FFA's most frequently given advice on wedding attire, and answer some questions that are often asked by those seeking advice. About a year ago /u/NoodlyGoodness posted a very helpful [Wedding Guest This post is intended to supplement that with additional practical and explicit suggestions. **Your Job as a Wedding Guest** Assuming you are not in the wedding party (in which case you have a different role to play on this Special Day), the things you should be looking to achieve with your outfit are probably the following: * To blend in, mostly, with what other guests are wearing. * To adhere to the etiquette, formality level and physical specifics (i.e. season, weather, ground surface) of the wedding's location. * To feel comfortable so that you can focus on enjoying the celebration and having fun with your friends and family. The following advice takes as an assumption that those are your goals. **Understanding Dress Codes** If your hosts have been helpful enough to mention the intended dress code for their wedding, your outfit selection should start there. If the invitation doesn't specify a dress code, it is completely ok to just ask the couple (or someone in the wedding party) what the dress code is. They'll be happy to tell you, especially if the dress code they're expecting is a very specific one. Below are some of the most common event dress codes and what they mean: * *Black Tie* means that men will be expected to be wearing tuxedos. Traditionally, black tie for women calls for floor-length evening gowns, though cocktail-length is sometimes acceptable. Think "red carpet at an awards ceremony" for this. For women, White Tie may constitute a minor step up from Black Tie, in which case floor-length gowns would be expected. See **Regional and Cultural Considerations** below for more discussion of this. Though in most cases Black Tie will be explicitly stated in the invitation, there are some regions and cultures (e.g. the American south) where a reception taking place after 6pm automatically implies Black Tie, [as Jack Donaghy can Use cues from the venue, the couple's families' cultures and the location of the wedding to determine whether this assumption could be in play. * *Formal* is probably similar to the way you would dress for a prom. Men may be in tuxedos or dark suits. For women, floor-length gowns or cocktail length in formal fabrics and shapes will work. "Black tie optional" is another way of specifying this dress code. * *Semiformal* specifically means that tuxedos and floor-length gowns are not expected (and may actually look out of place). Men should wear suits, and women should wear cocktail-length dresses, but avoid casual fabrics or shapes. If the wedding you're attending does not specify any dress code, you should start by assuming it's semiformal, and then use the considerations below to adjust that assumption up or down. * *Casual*, much like [Business is a dress code that spans an incredibly wide spectrum of expectations. It could be just another way of saying semiformal, or it could mean the father of the bride intends to wear jorts. If a wedding invitation specifies casual dress and you are unsure how to interpret that, I suggest starting from a semiformal base and then adjusting one or two aspects of your outfit - fabric, shoes, accessories or hairstyle - down a notch in formality. Semiformal dress at a casual wedding is unlikely to look out of place, because many guests (especially older family members) will likely dress semiformally for a wedding even if instructed that the dress code is casual. What if there's no stated dress code, or the dress code given makes no sense to you (e.g. "Mississippi cocktail attire" or "festive Muppet chic")? Here are some contextual hints you can use to help you guess the formality level. These are not foolproof rules, but should be taken into consideration along with all other known factors: * Evening weddings tend to be more formal than daytime weddings. * Outdoor weddings tend to be less formal than indoor weddings. * East coast weddings, anecdotally speaking, tend to be more formal that in the west. * The choice of venue can subtly suggest a lot about about a wedding's implied formality level. State parks, farms/barns and community centers generally indicate a more casual event. Galleries, museums, banquet halls and expensive restaurants usually suggest more formal attire. If you know that the venue you'll be attending is a popular place for weddings, visit their website or try to find photos online of weddings that have been held there before, and observe how guests tend to be dressed. Finally, if any part of the wedding takes place in a house of worship, you will want to be prepared with something to cover your shoulders (and possibly a lower hemline) while you are there. **Shapes, Fabrics and Colors** Remember that formality is a spectrum with many more settings than the four categories listed above. Shape, fabric and color are the main elements of a dress you can play with to either determine which dress code it falls under, or nudge it either up or down in formality within a dress code. Shapes: * [Evening are [fairly They come in a variety of silhouettes and bodice types, and are typically floor-length. The difference between an evening gown and a [maxi is mainly fabric composition - however it's crucial not to confuse one with the other. Maxi dresses are among the most casual type of wedding attire, and should only be worn when you know explicitly that the dress code is casual. * The safest styles to wear to a formal or semiformal wedding are and [sheath The exact formality level of these can be adjusted by your choice of color and fabric. * or styles can also work if the fabric and color is of the right formality, however they may look slightly less formal or more avant garde than their a-line and sheath equivalents. You may or may not desire this effect. * are not technically a shape, but a style of dress in one of the above shapes that is usually sleeveless and made of cotton. These are best worn at casual weddings (or outdoor, daytime semiformal ones). * [Shirt and [wrap dresses with tend to belong at casual weddings only. Your mileage may vary depending on the specifics of your situation - I suggest avoiding these styles if you're not certain that they are formal enough. * ["Fit and or [skater (which have a shorter, more circular skirt as opposed to [a-line seem to currently be on trend and may be appropriate in certain circumstances. Some factors to keep in mind are that a) these types of dresses tend to read more young, so if you are concerned about looking juvenile you may want to avoid them, and b) these styles very often are made of much more casual fabrics, which make them frequently unsuitable for semiformal weddings and above. * [Bodycon may be appropriate for a wedding at which you confidently expect a nightclub-like experience. If you are not sure that's the case I'd suggest avoiding them. Fabrics: I've listed a few example fabrics here in roughly descending order of formality: * Most formal: Satin, silk, fur, chiffon * Medium formality: Lace, brocade, crepe * Casual: Cotton, ponte knits, linen * Extremely casual: Jersey* knits, crochet The fabric a dress is made of is one of the largest determining factors in its perceived formality level, however it is by no means the only decisive factor. It is useful to think of fabric choice as a dial that can be turned up or down to make any given style of dress appear incrementally more or less formal. * Jersey can refer to many different types of knits, some of which are distinctly not casual. See part of the discussion below for more detail on types of jersey and what they connote. In the list above I am specifically referring to your everyday t-shirt material type of cotton jersey. Colors: Mainly up to you, but here are some things to keep in mind: * Darker colors and jewel tones generally read as more formal than brights or pastels. * Typically darker colors are worn when the weather is colder, and lighter ones when it's warmer. * Similarly, lighter colors and prints are more common at outdoor weddings than indoor ones. * Prints in general tend to make a dress look more casual. They are most easily applied at semiformal level or below. * Do not wear white or anything that looks like white. It is widely seen as an attempt to draw attention away from the bride. * Regarding red: To some people and in some cultures specifically, wearing red constitutes a similar suggested attempt to upstage the bride. See **Regional and Cultural Considerations** below for a discussion of this. * Wear black with some caution (see FAQ below). **Where to Shop** Even if you don't actually purchase from the retailers below, browsing these sites and stores should give you a wealth of examples of the type of thing you're looking for elsewhere... For black tie or formal weddings: * [Rent the Runway's black tie * [Nordstrom's formal * [David's Bridal's long formal dresses For formal weddings: * [Rent the Runway's cocktail dress * [David's Bridal's cocktail/party dress For semiformal weddings: * Most things in the formal section above * [Nordstrom's wedding guest dresses * [Modcloth's special occasion For semiformal or casual weddings after which you want to re-wear your dress to work: * [J. Crew's "wear to work" * [Ann (most styles) * [Banana (most styles) **Regional and Cultural Considerations** On Chinese weddings, via /u/teamwafflecake: &gt; For more traditional Chinese weddings, i.e., where the bride is wearing a red cheongsam/qipao, it'd be advisable not to wear red to avoid the "stealing the spotlight from the bride" faux-pas. Ditto for a less traditional Chinese wedding (i.e., one where the bride shows up in a white wedding dress) because there might be a Chinese elder who's going to think that's impolite and/or a chance the bride will change into a red cheongsam during the dinner/banquet. On South Asian weddings, via /u/hipsterhijabi: &gt; Tips for South Asian Weddings: Don't wear red, as that is a traditional colour for the bride to wear. Even if she's not, it'll be generally frowned upon. Don't put your dupatta (the long scarf that comes with a traditional suit) on your head! Unless you wear a hijab and are wearing it AS A HIJAB- but don't place it simply on your head. That is a bridal style. Avoid wearing anything with overly heavy handwork on it, or with too much good work. Avoid wearing a heavy lehnga (skirt). Opt for churidar, kameez or trouser style. avoid putting henna on your feet or past your wrists as that is a purely bridal style. On Black Tie after 6, via /u/servemethesky: &gt; One thing that may be worth noting is in certain areas (namely, the south), the time of the reception is actually a cue to dress code. I can't remember the precise cut off now, but for some people, a 7 or 8pm reception is supposed to implicitly suggest black tie, even if it's not stated on the invitation. On Black Tie and White Tie in the UK, via. /u/LadyFrog: &gt; Just a comment about black tie for women - as someone who goes to a lot of black tie events I find the rules in practice (in the UK at least) are slightly different from your interpretation. For women it is essentially cocktail dresses and sparkly jewellery. Floor length is not out of place but would more normally be worn to a black tie ball rather than a dinner event. &gt; If you were wearing floor length, furs and elbow length gloves that is white tie which is very different! Essentially white tie dictates floor length for girls and for guys top hat and tails. It's rarely used as a dress code these days except for some of the larger Oxbridge balls (and presumably other occasions) which is why people sometimes conflate the two dress codes. **FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS** **Do I need to dress in the color scheme of the wedding?** No, not unless you're in the ceremony. If you know that the wedding has "theme" colors, feel free to coordinate subtly if you really want to, but do not wear the actual same dress as the bridesmaids if you can help it. Otherwise let the season, time of day and personal preference be your guide. **Can I wear pants to a wedding?** Yes, but: if you are going to wear pants, you will still need to adhere to the stated or implied formality level or dress code. And if you are new to this or unsure, you may find it very challenging to choose a pants-based outfit that does that effectively. For example, for a formal or black tie wedding you would likely need to wear something similar to a suit or tuxedo. For a semiformal wedding you would want to wear a suit or something on the very high end of business casual. For a casual wedding, [business casual as defined in the FFA could work. **Do I have to wear heels?** No, but: if you are going to wear flats, you will still need to adhere to the stated or implied formality level or dress code. Taking away the heel from a shoe knocks it down a notch in formality, so you will need to use other factors (like materials, toe shape and color) to compensate for that to the degree necessary. Also keep in mind that depending on your body proportions and preferred silhouette, wearing flats will change the way the rest of your outfit looks and possibly how flattering you find it. **Can I wear white to a wedding?** No. Traditionally (in the US) it is seen as very rude for anyone other than the bride to be wearing white. Even if you don't think the bride will care, chances are there will be someone there who does. Avoid confrontations and awkward whispers by just not wearing white. **What about ivory? Cream? Beige? Champagne?** I'm not going to tell you this has never been done appropriately before, but wouldn't you rather not risk it? These colors read as white in certain lighting, in photos and from a distance - and it's not like someone who's extremely offended by your color choice is going to be suddenly mollified upon realizing that *actually, it's a DOVE GREY dress* when you explain that to them. Aim for an outfit that needs no explaining. **What if there is white included in a print on my dress?** Use your best judgment with regard to whether the dress looks white from far away, and if in doubt, don't wear it. Keep in mind that dresses with a white bodice, or a white shrug/shawl/jacket on top will look like a white dress when you are sitting down. **Can I wear black to a wedding?** Maybe. Traditionally, black is thought to indicate that you are in mourning or wish the couple ill, however in recent years this connotation has weakened somewhat (and many wedding parties now wear black themselves). Your best bet for wearing black will be if the wedding is higher on the formality spectrum, taking place in the evening or in winter, and accessorized with some bold or sparkly details or accessories. If you are unsure about wearing black, opt for navy or grey instead. **Can I wear red to a wedding?** Maybe. See **Regional and Cultural Considerations** above. Your best bet for pulling off red will be at a very casual, non-traditional wedding. If you are unsure about wearing red, opt for pink or orange instead. **But I went to a wedding once where everyone wore flip flops and muscle tanks! Surely that must be okay?** That sounds very fun! This guide is not intended as a comprehensive description of everything that anyone has ever gotten away with wearing to a wedding. Presumably if your hosts wanted you to wear flip flops and muscle tanks, they would let you know... and if you were comfortable wearing those things regardless of the hosts' instructions, you probably wouldn't be asking for advice here. *Is something missing from this post? Please let me know, and I'll continue to update. Right now this is heavily, heavily slanted toward weddings in the United States that are not very religious. I'd be happy to include considerations for specific religious customs or other countries if anyone would like to chime in with their expertise in those areas.*

I'd say about 50% of the new posts we get in this subreddit are asking their peers to help them find "their fashion style." Well, today, I'm going to outline a simple way to help find your style, complete with inspirations albums culled from various sources. There are MANY, MANY descriptors describing style and these terms can vary in meaning between person to person. Some that come to mind are preppy, twee, classic, bohemian, edgy, alternative, goth, tomboy, sporty, etc. In my personal opinion, many descriptors are completely meaningless. Why? Because fashion isn't something that is easily pigeonholed into categories. Regardless, I do have a few inspiration albums that should help you get started on figuring out what you like and what you don't like. [Preppy Inspiration [Bohemian Inspiration *courtesy of /u/wispmother* [Twee Inspiration *courtesy of /u/thenshesays for the good pictures* [The "No Color" Inspiration [Goth Ninja Inspiration *courtesy of /u/skysill* [Menswear Inspiration [Alternative/Edgy Inspiration *courtesy of /u/nixol* What you'll notice about these albums is that they are not all completely separate from one another. There are elements that appear in the Goth Ninja album that you can see in the Preppy album. So what should you do to find your style? Look through **ALL** of these albums and find elements of the styles that you like. Maybe you like plaid in general. Maybe you don't like color at all. Maybe you like collared shirts but you don't like twee. Maybe you like twee but you want it to be all black. See where I'm getting at? Fashion is fluid. It's nigh impossible to make distinct categories when it comes to fashion. Everything relates to everything else! **I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS. IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY INSPIRATION ALBUMS, PLEASE MAKE YOUR OWN! I WOULD LOVE TO SEE WHAT EVERYONE IS INSPIRED BY!!** There are no "rules" when it comes to fashion. Finding a style is as easy as looking! 
I hope I got rid of all the affiliate links. Damn Google! I thought I would put together a basic 30x30-esque capsule wardrobe, focusing on neutral basics to function as a foundation for a summer wardrobe. This capsule works well all by itself without needing any additional clothes, but it can also be built upon to add more colour or more item variety (dresses and skirts, maybe). I built this for everyday, casual wear so you’d need to build on this for fancy events or business (-casual) work wear. [Here]( is what the whole capsule looks like. I found items at 3 price points: low (think F21 and H&amp;M), mid (between Uniqlo and Gap), and “reach” (between Madewell &amp; Eileen Fisher). Some of these items are on sale, some may yet go on sale, so the prices I indicate may change. Feel free to post your own suggestions for well priced similar items.

In today's General Discussion, we want to try something new, inspired by this week's [Come to thread. Since not all of us have been around for two years, and since not all of us are IRC regulars, take this opportunity to introduce yourself and get to know community members! You might want to share such things as where you're from, what you're doing with your life (school/work/etc.), what you're interested in (in terms of hobbies and in terms of personal style), what drew you to FFA, what you're hoping to gain from FFA, **pictures of your pets,** whatever's going on in your life, etc. etc. Have at it!

A few of you saw my post in the "Random Thoughts" thread, so I decided to post a small inspiration album here to FFA. With the weather cooling off in the NE, I've started looking at F/W fashion and really been inspired by all black outfits. Here is a collection of some looks I really like, and some non-fashion photos that inspired me with their use of structure, shape, texture, and layering in varying shades of black. My style tends towards the model-off-duty look, but I tried to vary it a little bit here to showcase how different elements of design (especially texture IMO) can take center stage when color is removed. I don't really "get it" as much when I'm working or looking at outfits in color, so breaking things down to all black really makes me appreciate the other elements. I also live about 1 hour from NYC, so I may be partial to black as a color. [Murdered Out-an inspo 
This guide is meant for primary and secondary school, but if you teach college and are totally lost, you should be fine with the info here. **Tl;dr? Don't dress like a teenager; don't look too sexy; dress comfortably for the amount of movement your grade level requires; follow your school's internal guidelines. If you do all of these things, you will be fine. If you want to be better than fine, read on.** The main goals are looking *professional*, *mature*, and *accessible*. You should also be comfortable. Teachers can wear things that would not fly at office jobs--a benefit of being in a woman-dominated field. But it is still important to keep in mind that you are in a position of authority. You never know when you'll be going from reading *Harold and the Purple Crayon* to meeting with a parent. **The Basics** * Take other teachers as your example. Every school (and grade level) is different. Start by erring on the side of overdressing then get more casual if you want, and it's acceptable at your school. * If you are a young woman, **avoid shopping in the juniors section.** (If you are not young, and you still shop in juniors, we have more problems to deal with.) You need the more mature cuts and higher quality of women's clothes to look authoritative. It sucks, but studies have shown that male teachers are taken more seriously. Make sure it looks like you take *yourself* seriously. * While you should (duh) not be dressing intentionally "sexy," it is not your responsibility to keep teenage boys from ogling you. You do not have to be a frump to be a good teacher. * Part of looking like a teacher is styling and self-presentation beyond clothes. You should be well-pressed and neat. Even if your clothes are fine, the look does not convey a teacherly air. * Before you get started on style, you need to start at square one-- make sure all your clothes *fit* and look good on *you.* Check out these other FFA resources: [Guide to [Guide to and other sidebar guides. Get to know your local tailor. I have included a lot of inspo that work as complete teacher outfits. That said, the shoes in many of these images are either not appropriate or not comfortable for teaching.

There is nothing *wrong* with cardigans-- [they can look great with the right but why not try a * Almost any kind of shirt is fine. Button ups, button downs, tee shirts, shells, sweaters. Check out the other sections for more shirt inspo. **Skirts** * Make sure the length is comfortable and appropriate for the amount of movement you do-- this is dependent on your grade level. * The cut of skirts, too, affects the way they move when you bend over and move around. [Fuller have more leeway here. * [Pencil are good, too, but make sure they are not too tight. This can get into sexy teacher fantasy territory pretty quickly. * [Here is a bunch of teacher-appropriate skirt **Dresses** * Think: structured and well fitting but not tight. * [Shirt [sheath and [[faux] wrap are good options. * As with skirts, consider the length in relation to the kind of movement your job requires. * [More **Chinos (a.k.a. khakis)** * Choose pants that are not too tight or low rise.

If you do not know which is which, your workplace is probably fine with either. * [Some **Jeans** * Many schools allow teachers to wear jeans. If you cannot, disregard this section. * And again I say, not too tight, not too low rise. * Dark wash, unembellished, undistressed jeans will keep you from looking like a high school student, and they look more professional. Straight leg or skinny (not thin, skin-tight jeggings) are both appropriate. * not or * **Shoes** * You know your own ability to stand all day in specific shoes, but Danskos are not the only comfortable shoes. Gel inserts are your friend. * [ankle and are all good choices, if you can't/don't want to do a heel. * [Low heels and are also good. (Many people who find heels hard to tolerate all day are comfortable in wedges thanks to the additional support.) * Avoid [soaring stiletto heels or other sexy If you are comfortable in heels, then knock yourself out, but anything higher than 3" is probably too much. * Open-toed shoes may or may not fly in your school. I think this is largely regional-- in some places, they are a no go; in others they're fine. * Toms and other are just too young-looking and casual. They are basically meant to be worn outdoors in the summer, and they look it. * Teachers can wear sneakers in many schools, especially primary schools. They are comfortable and sensible, if you are chasing grubby kids all day. BUT they can veer into messy, juvenile, or just plain unfashionable territory *fast*. It is best to steer clear of sneakers with visible branding. [A plain, comfortable sneaker (probably that matches what you're wearing is probably your best option.

If you follow the guidelines so far, you should be fine, but here are a few more things to consider. * *Make sure your clothes fit you well*. I have already said it, but it bears emphasizing. Read the sidebar links, stop buying clothes in the juniors section, and go to a tailor. Nothing makes you look less authoritative than ill-fitting clothes. * Avoid extremely trendy items.

Non-iron is also a plus. * If you wear skirts/dresses, consider wearing bike shorts underneath, so when the kids crawl under your legs, they cannot announce the color of your underwear. * Avoid white or other very stain-showing colors. 
It seems like every time I go shopping, I try on basic tees (especially lighter-colored ones) that are completely see-through. I don't want to have to wear an undershirt, I'd rather just have a t-shirt I can slip on and be done with it. Is this a trend? Does anyone know where I can find shirts that aren't? I used to have a white shirt from J-Crew that was awesome and not see-through, but unfortunately it's too small for me and I haven't been able to find a replacement. Thanks! Edit: I haven't posted on reddit very much, very cool to see all your responses. Thank you for all the tips and ideas! I have some shopping to do this weekend... 
If you were alive in the 1980s or had a mother who was, you are probably familiar with the concept of having a “season” (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) based on your personal coloring, which determined which colors you can and can’t wear. And if you’ve gotten further into this concept via fashion magazines or [Into you may have tried earnestly to analyze the color of your veins or the brightness of your eyes, to varying degrees of success, and probably some confusion. This guide will take you further into the concepts of personal color analysis (“PCA”) and try to alleviate some of that confusion. **Why would I want to know my colors?** I feel like I should start with an important disclaimer: *I am not here to tell you what colors you are and aren’t allowed to wear.* Many people don’t care about PCA, don’t “believe” in it (as if it’s some variant of astrology), or just aren’t interested in taking their natural coloring into account when they dress. That is completely fair and valid. Like the [dressing for your guide, this is intended to help you understand the concepts of PCA and use them if you want. With that out of the way, there are a lot of reasons to want to wear colors that harmonize with your natural coloring: * It can make you look younger and healthier * It can put people visually at ease when they see you, helping to garner subconscious trust and respect * It can give you a framework for building a wardrobe of colors that all harmonize with *you* and therefore also with each other * Knowing your season can help you avoid buying things that you later feel like you don’t look good in * Knowing your season can suggest to you colors that would look great on you that you haven’t thought of before, or don’t tend to stumble across in stores **Characteristics of color** Let’s define some terms that will help us put colors into groups for the purposes of PCA. First, a color can be light or dark. This refers to how close it is to either white or black. Pretty straightforward. Here’s a [light and here’s a [dark Also, a color can be warm or cool. In PCA, this refers to how much yellow (warm) or blue (cool) is in it. You may be familiar with this concept from shopping for red lipstick. Here is a [warm and here is a [cool IMPORTANT NOTE: There is a spectrum of warmth and coolness within every color. Even yellow and blue themselves: * [Warm vs. [cool * [Warm vs. [cool Finally, a color can be bright or muted. This refers to how saturated the color is compared to gray. Brightness/mutedness is not the same as lightness/darkness. Muted and bright colors can be either light or dark. When you think “muted,” think “more gray.” Here is a [bright and here is a [more muted pink of a similar **Why are you talking so much about colors? Tell me my undertone.** Ok, so you may have heard the term “undertone” or taken a quiz online that tries to match up your hair, eye, vein and jewelry color to a particular season. I don’t think this is particularly helpful, for a lot of reasons including the following: 1. You can’t “see” undertone. Even if you try to guess by examining your veins, there are a lot of factors that will make them look blue or purple or green (green compared to what?) aside from your undertone. Like how light or dark your skin is, where on your body you’re looking, and what you’re comparing them to. 2. By all accounts, most people’s undertone is neutral, leaning very slightly warm or cool. So if you examine your attributes (blue veins, brown eyes, tan easily, look good in gold, WTF?) you are likely to get a pretty mixed bag. 3. Arbitrary attributes are hard to set boundaries around in words. What is blonde hair? Obviously is blonde, and so is but is How about If you try to determine your season solely by your attributes, you may get frustrated just defining what those attributes are. 4. How your attributes look varies based on what colors are surrounding them right now. That’s kind of the whole point! So it’s hard to look in the mirror, or look at a photo, and see objectively where your personal coloring falls on the three scales described above. Though there are certainly common patterns in the attributes of different seasons, the attributes are not the definition. Every season contains a wide variety of different hair colors, eye colors and ethnicities. The best way to talk about types of personal coloring is in terms of *what colors look harmonious on them*. **The 12 seasons** Contemporary PCA divides coloring into twelve seasons (listed here in order of adjacency)… * [**True looks most harmonious in colors that are cool, medium-to-very bright and medium-to-very dark. * [**Bright looks most harmonious in colors that are bright, medium-to-very dark and slightly cool. * [**Bright looks most harmonious in colors that are bright, medium darkness and slightly warm. * [**True looks most harmonious in colors that are warm, medium-to-very bright and medium darkness. * [**Light looks most harmonious in colors that are light, medium brightness and slightly warm. * [**Light looks most harmonious in colors that are light, low-to-medium brightness and slightly cool. * [**True looks most harmonious in colors that are cool, medium brightness and medium darkness. * [**Soft looks most harmonious in colors that are muted, medium darkness and slightly cool. * [**Soft looks most harmonious in colors that are muted, medium darkness and slightly warm. * [**True looks most harmonious in colors that are warm, medium-to-very dark and medium brightness. * [**Dark looks most harmonious in colors that are dark, medium-to-very bright and slightly warm. * [**Dark looks most harmonious in colors that are dark, medium brightness and slightly cool. **What is ‘harmony’?** Put a color near your face, and look at your face (not the color). What do you observe? A harmonious color seems to look like it “belongs” to your face, like nature dressed you that way. Everything looks normal and nothing looks distorted. Sometimes it’s easier to recognize signs of disharmony, which can include: * Blotchy or uneven looking skin tone * Emphasized redness in the skin * Emphasized yellowness in the skin * Emphasized shadows or dark undereye circles * A grayish pallor * Your skin taking on the same hue as the color you’re holding up * An effect where individual facial features seem to disappear * An effect where your eyes are drawn to the color you’re holding, rather than your face Not sure what you’re seeing? Hold up a different color, and observe any changes. Better or worse? Different? Different how? The above experiment is easiest to judge in natural light, without makeup on, and in the most neutral-colored environment you can create. **So how can I determine my season?** It sounds kind of tautological, but the best way to determine which colors look good on you is to test which colors look good on you. You can either do the above, many many times, with a huge array of different colors, or you can see a certified professional color analyst to do just that for you. They call it “draping,” and it’s a lot like when you go to the eye doctor and they have you sit down without glasses on and try to read things under various settings, asking you “1… or 2? 3… or 4?” and gradually narrowing it down versus just asking you a bunch of questions about what glasses you like to wear and then proclaiming that you’re a -1.75. There are some advantages to having this done professionally as opposed to experimenting yourself over many hours or years. One of them is that a color analyst will usually have a tightly controlled environment - pure neutral gray room, neutral gray robe, full spectrum lights - that will let you do this experimenting in a way that controls for confusing factors. Another is that an analyst will have calibrated drapes of a full array of colors that are matched to the different seasons, that accurately represent the different color characteristics, and that may be different than what you are able to find in a retail environment or your own closet at any given time. **That sounds expensive and time consuming, how can I determine my season myself, today?** Ok, do you have an hour to kill and access to a MAC counter and a patient friend? [Here are some to figuring out your season that may or may not work for you, but at least are a better proxy than trying to figure it out based on your hair color. A couple of things to keep in mind if you try to go the quick DIY route: If you take that quiz at the bottom of the page I linked, follow the instructions and have someone else take it for you. Remember that the names of colors - even really specific-sounding ones like *fuschia* or *beige* - can encompass a wide variety of different actual colors that may or may not look good on you. Not every makeup recommendation within a given season will be ideal for you, given the ranges of color characteristics within a season and the fact that colors you wear *on* your face need to be a bit more particular than those you wear in clothes, plus the fact that people have different tastes in makeup irrespective of what is just harmonious. **Can you tell me my season? Here are some photos.** No, and it should be obvious why not if you’ve read this far. Even if people could tell you your season just by looking at you, photography itself and the display of photos on different screens will alter the colors we’re looking at anyway. You will need to experiment. **I dyed my hair. What season am I now?** A different hair color won’t change your natural season, but it might make clothes and makeup look different on you. Especially if your new hair color *isn’t* ideal for your coloring, it can make the colors that would otherwise look harmonious on you look off. A different hair color may make it easier to “borrow” colors from other seasons on the spectrum, but it will not make you a different season. **Does my season change if I have a tan?** No. But you may find that you prefer different colors in your palette (especially for makeup) when your skin is darker or lighter. **But I already know what looks good on me!** Like I said at the outset, you are free to wear whatever colors you want. But I will say that people tend to be extremely non-objective when it comes to judging their most harmonious colors. A lot of us have gone through life with some deeply held convictions (or statements made by others) about what does and doesn’t look good on us, which are easy to internalize over the long term. In addition, you probably have a color palette that you *tend* to wear for the purposes of wardrobe cohesiveness (or in alignment with current color trends), and it can be easy to conflate “what I usually wear” with “what looks best on me.” Finally, many people have immediate aesthetic reactions to colors based on their “hanger appeal” that have little to nothing to do with how harmonious the color is with our actual skin. The colors that look best on you might not be the ones you gravitate to in a store, or the ones that make your friends go “I looove that sweater!” **What if I hate my season or love colors I’m not supposed to wear?** It’s important to remember that every season has a wide-ranging palette. If you do subscribe to and care about PCA, it’s not like you’re only allowed to wear four colors and all others are verboten. Think of your palette like a lens through which you look at color (how bright? how warm? how dark?) rather than a list of approved colors. You might look horrible in one company's "oxblood" but really good in someone else's "maroon," and it all comes down to slight differences in hue, darkness and saturation. **Suggestions for Further Reading** Pretty much an endless trove of insight on PCA. Check out the “celebrities” sections under each season for great examples of harmonious vs. non-harmonious colors on various faces. [12 Blueprints on Many examples of clothes and makeup in action.

A month ago, I [issued a to the FFA and MFA communities - document your everyday outfits for a month. Well, the month is up, and your submission thread is here! Let's see those albums. *It is strongly suggested that albums contain a minimum of 14 pictures.* --- **FAQ** *What if I wore PJs all day?* Post them. That was your outfit. *What if I wear a uniform that might identify me?* You can blur/block nametags, and if the uniform is too identifiable, feel free to leave it out. I'm not here to invade your privacy. (Bonus PJ pics from those days are always welcome!) *What if my outfits are boring?* Post them. This isn't about having the best collection of outfits, this is about looking at how we dress every day. It's to help us learn to look at trends and patterns rather than details! *Should I post the brands/set a personal goal/otherwise go above and beyond daily selfies?* Anything more than compiling an album of outfits is totally voluntary. 
[**Two Budgets, One ------------------------------ The following text comes from the [FAQ's on MFA's curtesy of /u/jdbee * Don't think of this as $128 or $2,095 for *one outfit* - that's not the right way to shop, and it's not the right way to approach this graphic. It's a collection of versatile pieces that you can/could/should mix and match with what you already own. They happen to look good in this particular combination, but everything in the image is versatile and it'll look good with the other stuff in your closet too. Shopping for versatile pieces instead of distinct outfits is one of the core principles of FFA. * Some things cost a lot because a designer sprays their name across the front, but other things are expensive because of the design, materials, type of construction, and/or place of manufacture. Don't reject the latter because you only have experience with the former. That said, if you're honestly curious about what makes a pair of jeans worth $300+ to someone, definitely ask. * "Don't waste your money on the expensive stuff when there's similar-looking cheap stuff," is absolutely not the point of this. The goal is to inspire, inform, and maybe spark a discussion about values and budgets. 
As a long-time lurker of FFA, I've been noticing a lot of posts about if this color works with another color. I will disclaim that I know almost absolutely nothing about fashion, but what I *do* know is about colors and the color wheel. I am currently an art student but every artist should know about the color wheel and how to manipulate colors; essentially, a colored wardrobe is what that is--manipulating colors successfully to bring out the best look possible for different colored people. So you must be wondering, **what *is* the color wheel?** [Well, this is a color (albeit not a very good one, but I'll try to find a better picture, or just paint one myself :\ but this will just get my message across for now) Well, you FFA's must be wondering what's up with this rainbow? Well, there are **3 primary colors** that make up all the rest of the colors in the rainbow. *Red, Blue, and Yellow* are the *3 Primary Colors.* Now, a very simple color mixing idea: * Red + Yellow = Orange * Blue + Yellow = Green * Red + Blue = Violet [Orange, Green, and Violet are 3 *Secondary Colors* whereas Red, Blue, and Yellow are the 3 *Primary With me so far? So those are the secondary colors. Now, we will move on to the **tertiary colors.** To make tertiary colors, you take primary colors and mix them with a secondary color. * Yellow + Green = Yellow-green * Yellow + Orange = Yellow-orange * Red + Orange = Red-orange * Red + Violet = Red-violet * Blue + Green = Blue-green * Blue + Violet = Blue-violet [This is a color wheel showing the different tertiary Now that you have some of the basics of the color wheel, let's add a little bit more information. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ **Color schemes** There are different color schemes: * Analogous color scheme * Complementary color Scheme * Split-analogous color scheme * Split-complementary color scheme * Triadic color scheme * Tetrads color scheme * Neutral color scheme * Accented neutral color scheme * Warm and cool color schemes * Monochromatic color scheme ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ **Analogous color scheme** One color scheme that is definitely something that is always used in fashion, and something that is super easy to apply is called **analogous color scheme**. Analogous colors schemes are color schemes that take three colors that are next to each other in the color wheel and make something out of them. [This is a color wheel Analogous color schemes are very popular in fashion as well. Here are some examples: [This is a super easy example for you to show and see what I'm trying to explain to you Notice how everything is using Blue, Blue-green, and Green? That's a way to apply the color scheme to your wardrobe. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ **Complementary color scheme** Now, you FFA-ers must be wondering why Yellow + Violet, Red + Green, or Blue + Orange isn't a tertiary color combination? Well that's because all those combinations are *opposites* of each other and they are called **complementary colors.** Have you noticed? Red + Green are Christmas colors, but outside of the holidays, they seem to go so well together. They *complement* each other ~~(*duhh*)~~. Another reason they are called complementary is because, theoretically, if you mix 1:1 ratio of those colors together they make each color duller, making it gray. If you refer back to one of the color wheels, any color across from each other, called color opposites make a complementary color. Meaning these colors make a complement: * Red + Green * Yellow + Violet * Blue + Orange * Yellow-green + Red-Violet * Yellow-orange + Blue-Violet * Red-orange + Blue-Green If you would like to dress really boldly, you can try to go for the complementary color scheme: [Yellow + [Or even the middle ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Split-analogous color scheme** Split analogous color scheme is a color scheme that includes a primary color and two colors one space away from it on each side of the color wheel. [An example is yellow, green, and ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Split-complementary color scheme** Split-complementary color schemes are colors that follow a primary color and the secondary colors surrounding the primary colors' complement. For example, [Red + Blue-green + Yellow-green make a split-complementary color [here is an Please excuse my crappy tastes. This is for example only... ;;&gt;_&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Triadic color scheme** As the implies, the traidic color scheme makes a triangle on the color wheel. For example, the primary colors, red, blue, and yellow make a triadic color scheme. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Tetrads color scheme** Tetrads or quadrads are any four colors with a logical relationship on the color wheel, such as double complements such as yellow + violet and green + red ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Neutral color scheme** Now a lot of people mention neutrals on FFA so here are the list of neutrals. Neutral colors are colors not found on the color wheel. These are the netural colors * Beige * Brown * Gray * Black * White ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Accented neutral color scheme** Accented neutral color scheme includes 1 or more bright/bold colors in tiny bits or small *accents* with a neutral color. For example, brown and beige with blue accents or gray and black with red accents. [This is another Another way to wear accented colors is black/white and red accessories or something of the sort. You get the idea. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Warm and cool color schemes** During season changes, the colors change as well. For example, summer and spring seasons tend to use warmer colors and fall and winter use cooler colors. What does this mean, you say? Warm colors include: * Red * Red-Violet * Yellow * Orange.... etc. Cool colors include: * Blue * Green... etc. **THIS IS IMPORTANT MUST READ** I want you guys to know that orange can be a cool color too! If orange has more blue in it than orange then its more of a cool color. The colors I've listed are just basic guidelines. The same thing applies with purple. There can be a [warmer colored or a [cooler colored (although that horse saddle is almost blue-violet but you guys get my point). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Monochromatic color scheme** Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a base hue (one color), and by adding black or white, making a different color. As a result, if you dress like this, colors will be a little bit more subtle and boring, but if you add some diverse patters in it, it could totally change things up. [Here it is on a color [Here is an example of monochromatic color ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *sigh of relief* Okay that was a lot of information. I hope you guys can take this knowledge and apply it to the future and no more posts about what color goes with what okay? :) There are very tricky colors however. For example, coral is really in right now and that goes with mint green but just remember to refer back to the original hues. Ask yourself, is this coral more red or orange? What's the complement with red? So the logic behind mint green + coral is pretty easy--they're complements! I hope you all can apply this knowledge to the future. If there are any objections, questions, or corrections to this post that you believe is incorrect, please post down below and I will see to it if it is correct. And I will fix it. Thanks for your time guys! EDIT: or is :D 
Last Thursday we [announced the for this week's theme WAYWT and today is the day for submissions! Show us your worst fashun phases pleaseeee **THIS IS WHERE YOU POST SUBMISSIONS. EVERY TUESDAY. YOU POST YOUR SUBMISSIONS HERE. NEVER ON THURSDAY. GOT IT?** 
So, I really enjoyed the concept behind the last [Change My View that /u/HOT_LOBSTER posted a week ago, and I thought it would be interesting to rehash the concept, but instead of changing people's opinions with words, we would respond with pictures that prove the contrary because, we're a super visual subreddit when it gets down to it. So, for those unfamiliar, the basic idea behind these threads is for a person to post about their opinion of something and have people try to change it. For instance: * I don't think Birkenstocks work. Could be countered with [this or with another example. Or: * I don't think I've ever seen a successful fit with JC Litas where they didn't look out of place/like clown shoes. Could be countered with (Okay, this one is kind of a joke. ^(A little.)) Part of the idea of this thread is to collect inspiration so feel free to post things like "I want to see instances of women wearing flyknits." 
WAYWT is the acronym for "What Are You Wearing Today". It doesn't necessarily need to be what you were wearing TODAY. * Post a photo of what you wore. * Include what the attire is for (work, school, home) and if applicable, what your fashion goals are (e.g. "I want to look professional," "I'm experimenting with loose-loose silhouettes") * **[Taking photos with your phone? Read this * Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but keep it constructive/factual, and try to focus on feedback that will help the person improve. * Do not downvote for disagreeing with with someone's opinion. * Reddit Enhancement Suite makes it very easy to view pictures in a thread. 
So basically, I hate spring and summer. I hate the humidity, the sweating, the pressure to wear colours, and I hate flip-flops, yada yada yada. I thrive in fall and wintertime, basically because of my infatuation with denim and sweaters and doc martens. Here is an album that is anti-spring/summer. It features lots of Converse, flat &amp; simple sandals, minimalist-ish colour palettes, and denim, of course. I have some questions too! Where can I find reasonable (I'm willing to spend around C$50) distressed and baggy jean-shorts? Where can I find simple, flat sandals? Where can I find these online or in (Canadian) stores? Please provide constructive criticism too! I think I'm going to build my summer wardrobe with this album in mind, so please save me from fashion faux-pas! Thanks for reading! :) ***EDIT:*** **Where do I buy those cool shorts!?** **Where do I buy these cool sandals?!!** **How do I survive summer?** ***EDIT 2:*** **Things that have been sent to me as suggestions that I love dearly** 
Donations must be made before the end of the year to count towards charitable tax write-offs. With that, now through the first couple weeks of the new year make for great thrifting! Just today I picked up an Ann Taylor suit set from the 2012 season for $15 at Goodwill which, as a new college grad, is amazing. Here a couple links to past FFA discussions with thrifting tips - 
Introduction --- Last week we announced the them of this week's WAYWT, and today is the day for submissions! Theme --- In case you missed it, the theme today is free for all. You can go visit the [announcement to look at various inspiration posts if you plan on throwing something together last minute :) Please post your outfits in this thread! Please include a description of the challenge you were issued along with your fit pic. 
Always loved CMV threads and seems like it's been a while since the [last so I thought I'd start a new thread. Basic idea is: * post your fashion opinions * respond to posts and convince them otherwise (pictures encouraged) Examples: * loafers look like granny shoes ^^exemplary ^^purposes ^^only ^^i ^^love ^^loafers * Kanye West x Addidas collection is a strike of genius/weird dystopian trash Doesn't necessarily have to be S/S items, and feel free to discuss/request/post inspiration pictures. Be polite and don't be dicks. 
So it's been a couple of months since the last CMV, so I thought it might be time for a new one. You don't have to only discuss S/S items, but that's probably where a lot of our heads are at right now. For reference: the first CMV thread, on MFA, is and the past two FFA ones are and The basic format: **post your opinion, and people respond trying to change it.** Pictures highly encouraged, but not necessary. So, for example, a response to "Wearing lots of black in the summer makes you look like a misplaced goth" might be "Wearing summer black looks sleek and intentional when it's done with classic summery shapes, like Combining the collective wisdom from /u/HOT_LOBSTER and /u/dwindling's posts: - Don't downvote in disagreement. Keep it civil. - Don't just post "yes I agree" in response, either—try to come up with some evidence why you do. - Feel free to post broader questions too, like "How do you wear lace-up sandals without looking like an extra in Spartacus?" for purposes of getting inspo and ideas. Okay, go. 
Today is the official day for submissions! Post your most shamefully beloved items here! Here is the original [announcement in case you missed it! 
She's always wearing clothes and shoes with cats on them and I think it's like really not cool. Some people were born cats. We're a culture, not a pair of shoes or sweatshirt. I was thinking about showing my displeasure by knocking all of her shit on the floor, then pooping directly in front of my litter box but not in it. How do you think I should handle it? 
Now before you downvote me to oblivion hear me out. I believe that it would be awesome to have a kind of swap where once every week or 2 weeks or something we post a WAYWT to /r/femalefashionadvice and they post one to our subreddit so that we can get feedback from each other and a different point of view. (Not that you guys aren't awesome and helpful, it would just be... different) EDIT: /u/ashleyraptor had a great idea and my vote for what I would like to see happen: &gt;I think there should be some sort of extra flair that we can use so we can easily distinguish the gender of the commenter 
[Last week we announced the Did you paint with all the colors of the wind? Post your fits here!

Saw over at /r/InternetIsBeautiful and thought it was worth sharing. 
edit: so, i have switched out all the images with imgur links. to view the album in its entirety, you can click i added where some of the bathing suits were from. all of the brands/stores i included i have had experience with and, for the most part, liked. additionally, i want to preface your reading this post with that fact that everything i have written, i have written from my own experiences and opinion, and, as such, YMMV. ---- I have a lot of bathing suits. I competitively swam from 4th grade to my senior year of high school and now swim for exercise. I also grew up on a lake and within 30 minutes of the beach, so I have a ridiculous amount of swimsuits in my possession. So this is me blathering on about my own experiences with bathing suits, styles, care, etc… **TYPES OF BATHING SUITS** **TOPS** If you’re looking to swim for exercise, buy one of these. They come in one pieces and [two If you are busty, make sure that you buy a suit that has plenty of coverage in your bust. Side boob is no bueno for lap swimming, as there is a strong possibility that your breast may pop out of your suit. It has happened to me and I have seen it happen. Additionally, for women with larger busts, I would suggest buying a suit with [thick as opposed to [thin as thin straps may be uncomfortable as you go through your work out. One last bit of advice: if you’re going to get a suit for doings laps, i would suggest getting a patterned one, as they age a little better than solid colors. For anyone interested in more advice on swimming and suits, etc, you can head over to /r/swimming. Great for tanning, awful for being active in the water. In my experience, these suit are prone to nip slips when in the pool or ocean, as the fabric becomes more slack when wet. Many styles come with a strap that is or and I would suggest choosing a suit with straps if you are considering entering the water to swim. I have also found that this style severely flattens the look of your bust. [**Bralette Style/Life Guard Two Great for being active, while still wearing a two piece suit. Provides fuller coverage of the bust. [**Halter Similar to the string bikini, but provides a little more coverage. A popular one piece style, as well. [**High neck Good for being active in the water. Bad for tanning. They are very trendy, so if you love [this stock up, as I am sure there will be a new swim trend next year. This word has different meanings in different places. In the States, it usually refers to a [one piece bathing suit with cut These are admittedly awful for tanning. They can look really good, but, unfortunately, unlike other one pieces, they are not as functional. I would not suggest actual swimming in one of these. In Europe, a monokini can mean a bathing suit bottom (i.e. no top). [**One One pieces are great. They’re perfect for being active in the water. They can be and [full and They’re great for concealing your tummy if you’re not in the mood to show it off. I am a champion of one pieces, especially since they have become more on trend. [**Push Surprisingly (or maybe not), these suits provide a lot of coverage and support, especially for women with larger busts. They are great for being in the water and lookin good on the beach, but are not so great for tanning. Additionally, many times they sell these styles in bra sizes [(like D, DD, E, as opposed to S, M, and L, allowing you to find a suit that fits better. [**Rash This is what you pop over your string bikini or bandeau when you want to go out and play in the water. It’s great for UV protection and preventing rashes form the sand when you’re boogie boarding (duh). Can be or [short [**String/Triangle Good for tanning because you can tie and untie as you wish. Prone to “wardrobe malfunctions” (lookin at you, Janet). Good for hiding being bloated (especially if it’s the Fourth of July and you’ve eaten a hundred hot dogs). Good for being active in the water. **BOTTOMS** [**Brazilian/Cheeky/V A little adventurous for the states, but I quite like this style. If you’re wearing to this to the beach, you go, girl. [**Bikini Medium coverage. Suitable for whatever. [**Board This is like a rash guard for your butt. This is what you throw over your string bottoms when you want to go play in the water. [**Boy Maximal coverage. Suitable for pretty much anything. Emphasizes hips. The most basic swim suit bottom. Suitable for pretty much anything. Medium coverage, moreso than a bikini bottom. [**High Controversial — people either love them or think they look like diapers. I love them, but they can be tricky to wear, so I suggest trying one on before you buy it. These are great for people who want to conceal their stomach, while still wearing a two piece. It can also be a [retro/retro-ish [**String bikini Don’t wear these if you are planning on playing in the water or swimming, as with little support and coverage on the sides, they will easily come off. They come with [without as well. [**Swim Can be modest or can be [Victoria Secret Admittedly a little bit matronly. **FAQ** **How do I take care of my swim suit?** This comes from years of experience caring for suits that got daily use in a chlorinated pool: * Immediately rinse the suit after you’ve gotten out of the pool or ocean. Jump in the shower. Take it off and throw it in the sink. Ideally, you should rinse your suit immediately after each swim and before sunbathing, as the sun + chemicals and minerals in the water may cause the fibers in your suit to decompose, fray, and discolor. When all is said and done and you’re changed, give your suit one last rinse. * Hand wash your swim suit in cold water when home with hand soap (or a mild detergent). Rinse. Don’t wring or twist your bathing suit. Just let it lay flat to dry out of direct sunlight. (I always left mine in the bath tub.) Don’t use a dryer unless your pool has a basket dryer. In that case, follow the dryer’s directions. Usually, you should wash your bathing suit after about 5 uses. **How do I avoid nip slip and over exposing myself?** First of all, buy a bathing suit that fits snugly in the fitting room. The fabric of your bathing suit will become slack when wet, creating diaper butt in the bottoms and loosening your top. Second, find a top that has fuller coverage with good straps and preferably a clasp fastening (as opposed to a tie). You can opt for a push up top, a bralette/life guard style top, or a high neck top for best results. Avoid strapless tops and string bikinis. Furthermore, at /u/t_maia's suggestion, you can get a bathing suit top in the correct cup and band sizes (i.e. bra sizing) to mitigate nipslip. "If you constantly have nipslip in your bras, get a larger cupsize." With this in mind, "strapless tops can be very supportive if they are the correct (bra) size." Additionally, avoid bottoms with ties or thin coverage on the sides. In my experience, these styles slip off and come undone more often. If you are really uncomfortable or just plain old unlucky, buy a one piece. **How do I accentuate my bust? How do I de-accentuate my bust?** To accentuate, get something with ruffles, a fringe, or embellishment, a push up bathing suit top, or a triangle bathing suit top (likely a string bikini). To de-accentuate, get a bandeau or bralette style bathing suit top. These typically flatten the bust. **How do I accentuate my hips? How do I de-accentuate my hips?** To accentuate your hips, wear boy shorts, something with a wide band, or a ruffle that hits you at the hips. To de-accentuate, wear a plain bottom, a string bottom, or a sleek swim skirt. 
*By popular request... I present /r/FemaleFashionAdvice's first WAYWT! I'll try and regularly post these as early as I can on Monday mornings.

It doesn't necessarily need to be what you were wearing TODAY. * Post as often as you like, but edit your first post with pictures * Include what the attire is for (work, school, home) * Pictures are incredibly encouraged as it's quite tough to imagine what someone else is wearing without them. * Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but keep it constructive/factual.

**Boots, Boots, Boots** Now that the cold is finally setting in for most of us, and since we've been getting a lot of questions about boots, here's a boot guide for FFA! Some notes before I go on: this is not a comprehensive guide by any means, and I welcome any input that you may have, so please add it in the comments and I'll edit the post as we go. This is also not a guide on boot *care*, but here's [a link that I stole from I'll also add that I don't know much about leather quality, but I think that is just generally problematic for women's shoes. BUT, you will **not** find quality leather boots below $100, so don't ask us! Expect to spend some money on your boots, especially if you're looking for a mid-calf or higher boot (more leather used=higher price). With all that said, I do hope that this guide provides you with some helpful information. **Types of Boots** Oh, we have a lot of types of boots, and most of them come in a range of shaft heights. So, we've got: * [Chelsea in and characterized by the elastic panels on the sides of the boot * [Combat in and characterized by lacing that goes up the boot, inspired by combat boots used, well, in combat. * [Riding in and inspired by [horse riding and characterized by a low heel and mostly a tall shaft (but available in other shaft heights for fashion/style choices) Among many other types of boots, like: * [engineer * [harness * [cowboy or * * or just Then there are specialized boots, like [snow or [rain which I will not be exploring here. **Heel Heights/Types** * super versatile and obviously easy to walk in * generally very easy to pull off, has some good lengthening effects if done right * [Stiletto this can verge on looking a little odd (such a small heel holding such a big boot!), but it can be done well. * [Chunky offers a really balanced look compared to a stiletto heel. **Shaft Height** * very versatile shaft choice, and probably most versatile out of all shaft heights. ankle boots, whether flat or heeled, work really well with pants, skirts, and dresses. they also allow you to play around with cuffing your pants, showing a sliver of skin, matching up your tights for ultra-long legs, etc. * this shaft height can be tricky, because if you have short legs, or are short, then you may end up looking shorter. it can work well if there's not a strong contrast between boot and pant/leg. for example, black pants + black mid-calf boots can work really well, but white pants + brown mid-calf boots may have too much contrast. * more versatile than mid-calf, but not quite as versatile as ankle. this is because a lot of the end result will depend on where it hits on your leg line (really close to the knee, a little bit over the calf, etc.). **Wide Calf and Narrow Calf Solutions/Options** First of all, Zappo's allows you to filter by calf circumference so you can find a variety of shoe options there. Most other sites will allow you to narrow it down by 'wide' or 'narrow' calf. Neither option is foolproof in my opinion, and I highly encourage you to try on boots in store, or order from sites that provide free return shipping. As /u/_whitenoise_ points out, [circumference correlates to shoe so make sure to read up how a measurement was taken. For example, uses a size 8.5 to measure boots. There are certain types of boots that are more forgiving for calves that outside of the 'norm' range, such as: * * *Resources* * [DUO calf circumference from 30 cm to 50 cm, or 11.8 in to 19.7 in. * calf circumference from 11 in to 21.75 in. **What Boots are Best for Me?** So much of this will depend on your lifestyle and shoe needs. There is no specific boot that you absolutely *need* to own. Here are some things to consider: * If you work in a business casual office, ankle boots will be very versatile for you. Really great in the winter under pants or with a skirt and tights in a matching color (to elongate the leg line). Boots with a taller shaft height will be more difficult to pull off, but I do think that a simple knee-high boot with a heel can look really great with an a-line dress (like a wrap dress); I think [this boot would be for this situation. Keep in mind the more [hardware and decorative the boot has, the more difficult it will be to pull off for business casual. * If you're a college student, you have a lot of freedom in regards to type of boot. I tend to gravitate towards [flat since that makes for easier walking. * If you wear a lot of skinny jeans or leggings, most shaft heights should work in theory (but as I said before, this will vary based on your proportions). * If you wear a lot of skirts, I think shaft height will heavily depend on the length of your skirt. You can do [knee-length skirt + knee-high or [short skirt + ankle or [short skirt + mid-calf or [short skirt + knee-high **On Quality** As I said before, I'm not terribly knowledgable about leather quality (although I do know that you should opt for full grain leather and disregard genuine leather). However, I do know a bit about construction quality. Unfortunately, I don't think that women's boots are terribly focused on the quality of construction. So, please take care of your boots. Don't wear them *every single day* or you'll put too much pressure at the points that bend with your foot. Put in boot trees (or folded magazines, pool noodles, etc.) in the shaft of your boot to prevent the leather from sagging. Please don't let your boots get [this If you take care of your boots, they'll keep your toes warm for a long time. **Cool Places to Buy Boots** * [John * * [Crockett &amp; * * * [MOTO Leather &amp; * [White's * * [Vintage Shoe **Extra Links** * /u/brodysseus suggests [boots at certain price * [comment from BIFL on boot **What I Want From You** * What brands do you recommend for boots? Please provide reasons for your recommendation. * Any other places to buy cool boots? * Boot Inspo Albums! I didn't discuss how to wear boots thoroughly, so please feel free to add those. 
First step is first: figuring out your size. Take a peek over at /r/abrathatfits and measure yourself accordingly. Now that you're armed with that information, you can start shopping for a bra. [*As a side note:* Keep in mind that just because you now know your size, that doesn't mean every bra in that size will fit you just right. Think of your size as a jumping board. Once you try on that size, take notice of what you need adjusted and then go up or down in the band or cup size. Also remember: if you're going up a band size, you're probably going to go down a cup size, and vice versa. Try them until you find your perfect fit. Different brands will make sizes differently. (See: [sister A problem many of you have probably encountered: bra straps showing up from under your clothes. A fashion faux pas for most people. Here are some different types of bras to help with the problem: I've tried to be comprehensive, but maybe I've missed some, feel free to add in the comments. One of the most common types of bras, they create a smooth shape under knit tops. They are usually seamless so that they are hidden under a lightweight knit top. It's almost like the t-shirt bra. It is cut a little lower across and helps with low necklines and helps with cleavage. These are everyday bras much like t shirt bras, but are more likely to have designs and lace than the t shirt bras. **[Push These bras have varying amounts of padding at the bottom or sides of the cups to push your boobs up and together, creating a lot of cleavage. blog post I saw a couple years ago illustrates it well) Push up bras are often advertised to make your breasts look 1-2 cups larger. I would say that's pretty accurate. It's almost like a shelf for your breasts. This bra is usually cut straight across and provides support while still showing the top half of your breasts and offering more cleavage. Good under boat neck, scoop neck and square neck tops. This type of bra has a strap or tie that goes around your neck but doesn't attach to the back band. Good for tops that have low or open backs. These are considered specialty bras. You are more likely to find them as swim tops or in bras that you can convert to a halter style, rather than a bra that is only a halter bra on its own. **[Racer / This type of bra has straps that come together in the center of the back. They're good for tank tops and shirts that have open shoulders and styles that cut out the sides in the back. They usually offer a little more support than other bras because the straps are pulled towards the center of you back more. (more cleavage) The bra could be made this way (and will have a front closure), or it can come with a J-hook that you can attach or leave unattached. (convertible style) **[Strapless Pretty self explanatory. They are strapless bras.. best with strapless tops. They work best when snugly fit so they don't slide up or down. Most come with a gel around the edges to help create friction and less slipping. Even though most of a bra's support does come from the band, I've found that they aren't great for support with larger breasts because even though they're supported, they tend to look "droopier" without the shoulder straps. **[Full figure/full High neckline bras that cover up almost all of your breast tissue. They are usually made for plus sized women or women with very large breasts looking to eliminate the quadruple boob effect. These bras are incredibly supportive and can have a minimizing effect. **[Bodice These bras extend past your breasts with extra fabric. These bras usually aren't the most supportive as the fabrics are thin and they are usually unlined. They add more coverage and are often worn underneath tops that have side cutouts. In these cases, they're visible under clothing, but they are styled in a way that it doesn't look "revealing" or inappropriate. (they're essentially mini tank tops/spaghetti straps) The other option for these kinds of tops are (which are strapless) They have very low centers and deep V's for plunging necklines. These bras usually have padding on the sides of the bra to create more cleavage for your deep-v tops. *They don't have to be as extreme as pictured. If the center of the bra dips down in a deep V, it's a plunge bra. Sexy, mostly sheer/see through bras that have no lining or padding in them. They show off your natural shape while providing ~~very light support (if it has an underwire).~~ *I've been corrected. Unlined bras can offer very good support! ~~They aren't often worn as every day bras because the unlined aspect of it doesn't really cover or conceal pointy nipples.~~ (I try to get away with them if I'm wearing a loose shirt though, I've found them to be very comfortable) They come in many different styles, just unlined. Bras that can be converted into different styles in order to accommodate different requirements. They can be worn regularly, single strap, cross-back, halter, ect. There are also things you can buy separately that can help with these transformations. Bra strap extenders (if you need a larger band) or wrap around extenders if you need a much lower back. Hooks and straps to pull the bra straps into a racer back, and clear straps to be less visible. **[Sticky/adhesive These bras stick onto the front of you only. There are no straps, they don't wrap around the back. Because of this, they don't provide much support for larger breasts-- though the adhesive sticker bras do provide a little bit of lift. Good for completely backless tops and dresses. I'll also include nipple pasties in this section: for just covering your nipples. Good if you don't need support and just want to smooth out your nipples. **[Specialty Decorative, beaded, or clear straps. They replace removable straps on bras with a more deliberate looking strap. The clear straps are to help blend into the skin, but in my experience, they're still pretty visible. (I highly discourage wearing clear straps) For the most part, women want their bras to be hidden under their clothing. Find the right bra for the types of clothing you have. A well fitting multi-way bra is a good investment as they offer the more variety and usage. Sometimes, you might want your bra to be seen. Most likely though a cutout or sheer top. Keep in mind that these are mostly only acceptable in either very casual settings or evening settings (think club) of some tops that might require specialty bras Hope this helps. :)

Alright, I know a lot of people here are curious about Nordstrom’s personal stylist service. I just used it for the first time this past Saturday so I thought I’d report on my experience! To start with, after filling out a form on Nordstrom’s website you’ll be contacted by someone in their personal stylist department and asked to answer some basic questions - are you shopping for a special occasion, describe your style, anything you feel is missing from your wardrobe. After answered those I was set up with a stylist at the specific Nordstrom I would be going to. That stylist then called me to ask more detailed questions such as typical outfits I wear, my work dress code (which is none for me), my sizes, also miscellaneous things like whether I like to wear blazers or like to belt dresses/tops. I’m sure FFA will be happy to know the last one was an adamant no. She also asked for my budget - disclaimer here, I told her I did not have any budget constraints so that may have affected the stuff she showed me. At the actual appointment, I went to Nordstrom’s personal stylist area and my stylist already had a room set up for me with a number of outfits picked out including shoes and jewelry. I had told her on the phone that I like Rag &amp; Bone and Elizabeth and James, so she’d even pulled some items from those brands from a different Nordstrom 20 miles away (they were not available at the one I went to)! Already impressed. The other brands she pulled for me included a lot of Joie, Vince, Helmut Lang, Equipment and Diane von Furstenburg. I was surprised that the majority of what she chose I liked and fit in with my style, with just a few things that were definite no’s. Although I’d told her I mainly wanted to find a dress to wear to weddings, she also set aside some really hot little black dresses and a number of casual outfits. As I tried things on I told her what I did and didn’t like, and she would take things back, bring new suggestions and get different sizes as needed. She was also happy to suggest jacket, shoe, and accessory pairings for the outfits I tried on and I never felt rushed to make a decision. The whole appointment took around two hours, and I bought six pieces - two dresses, two pairs of pants, a sweater and a pair of ankle boots. I won’t lie, there was a bit of subtle pressure to buy something as the stylists do get paid on commission, but I wouldn’t say it was unreasonable. I never felt she was trying to sell me on something that really didn’t look good on me. I had the hardest time choosing what to buy because there were just so many things I liked! When I was checking out the stylist even offered to text me and let me know when items she thought I’d like came in or went on sale. So given that, I would say this is probably going to be a continued relationship for me. I found the experience a lot more fun and less stressful than shopping for a new wardrobe on my own, and could absolutely see myself going back maybe once a season. In summary: I recommend this service for anyone looking to refresh their wardrobe or get a special occasion outfit. I would come prepared to buy at least one item, but the stylists will respect your budget. Also, funny side note, stylist was coincidentally the same salesperson who talked me into a leather jacket back in December AND she totally remembered me. ~BFFs~ 
Just a quick PSA if you're like me and love wearing flats: For the last few months I had a pain in my left big toe that made me unable to bend it. After seeing my x-rays, the podiatrist said my tendon is messed up and it was probably caused by my wearing flats too often (read: almost every day)! Specifically, shoes with no support and the kind where you can bend the shoe in half. So, now I have to wear this obnoxious shoe with a really stiff sole while I take anti-inflammatories. On the bright side, she didn't say I need to start wearing orthopedic shoes, but did say I need to get pairs with stiff soles. Doctor's orders were literally to go shoe shopping. tl;dr Vary your shoe choices if you wear flats all the time so you don't cause some serious damage to your feet!

If you’re reading this, you probably either realized you’re 26 and dressed like you’re 13, just got dumped and using this as a coping mechanism, realized that dressing well [is not just for gays anymore]( want to get chicks/dudes, or just are reading this because you’re curious. This guide is an introduction into developing your own style. By no means do you have to follow this, or is developing your personal style or tastes a journey with ends, but here are just some tips to help start those who are new to dressing better on their way, so they don't have to face as many regrets as, I'm sure, many of us did along the way to finding our style. ---- ~**STOP**~ ---- and read the sidebar. It is a great source of knowledge. You’ll find most of the things you’ll want to there or our You’ll find the [fit guide]( which will be important because, chances are, you don’t know how clothes should fit you. Read through the things you are interested in and internalize everything. Don’t buy anything, unless you really need to, until you have digested all of this. It’s almost overwhelming to look at all the resources on the right of this sub, but it’s definitely worth it when you have gone through it. ---- **Lurk** Start reading threads on the front page, and figuring out what interests you, and the type of thoughts that people consider when putting together an outfit (for which you'll find another sidebar resource Look at the WAYWT threads that are posted, and look at what our users are wearing, and what you like and dislike. In fact, if there's something that you particularly like, you could probably pm that user asking about it (I promise, most of us don't bite). Looking and observing is an important step to finding your style as you go along. Look at inspiration albums that are posted and read through guides and other posts. Don't be afraid to ask questions on those posts or in the Simple Questions threads. Look through Need/Want thread, recent purchases, and Should/Shouldn't I Buy threads, and start looking at other users' rationales to help develop your own. ---- **Buy cheap clothes** Chances are your style and tastes will change while you’re on this journey, I know mine have. One of the merits of fast fashion, in my opinion, is the ability to try and experiment with clothing and not being penalized too much fiscally for doing so. Buy clothes from H&amp;M, Zara, Uniqlo, ASOS, etc. so you can figure out what styles of clothing suit you and your body without spending a fortune doing so. It probably won't look as good as the expensive stuff, but you'll get a general idea on the aesthetic. You'll discover things that you thought you might like, you don't; and things that you thought you'd hate actually look pretty good. Take a look at the [Basic from the side bar (seeing a theme here). You don't have to buy everything, but the pieces there are there because they are versatile and will fit many styles/occasions. Post your outfits to the Outfit Feedback and Fit Check threads, and I'm sure you'll get tons of helpful and constructive criticism from other users. ---- **Dress for occasion** Barney Stinson would look really dumb in real life. You don't need to wear a suit in real life everywhere, and you'll look and feel really out of place in most events (unless you were coming from work or something). *Dressing well does not equal dressing up*. An important rule in fit is *fit*ting the occasion you're dressing for. If you're going out to a bar with some friends don't wear a suit, but if you're going to an opening night gala don't wear a t-shirt and jeans. Figure out what is appropriate, and if it's not on the sidebar, somebody probably mentioned it, and you could search for it. ---- **Buy quality/unique pieces** At this point, you have hopefully discovered what aesthetic and style you want to go for, and you've developed your personal taste ([here's another side bar thread to check Now you want to start making a list of things you want to buy (many of us colloquially refer to this as a "cop list"). Start finding the pieces that you dream about and lust for and make a list of them. You may even want to try the [French Wardrobe which will help you buy the pieces you really want, not just the pieces you're on the fence about. Now is when you start buying the cool stuff, and the things that you buy-for-life/express your style. Post to WAYWT with fits you are proud of, and show off to us. ---- I hope this helps, and if you have any suggestions or criticisms please tell me. 
[Last week we announced the Post your grown-up outfits and maturity transformations here! 
So it's been a month since I challenged you all to try out a [more minimalist so let's see the results! Show us your picture albums, and tell us about how the challenge went! Here are some questions to consider: * What did you learn? Did your expectations/predictions match what actually happened? * Were you happy with the variety in your outfits, or did you not like wearing the same clothes all the time? * Did you come across any new combinations that you wouldn't have normally tried? Was there a color palette you really liked? * Was there any particular piece you found yourself wearing often, or did you find that there were gaps in your wardrobe that could be filled by a specific piece? Was there a piece you found surprisingly versatile or useful? * If you could go back and choose again, would you pick different pieces? * If you could add any 5 items to the ones you wear wearing, which items would they be? The last few questions really tie this minimalist wardrobe challenge to the idea of the French Wardrobe: It's a style philosophy that is based on having a wardrobe full of curated, versatile basics that fit your own personal style. Each season, you limit yourself by planning out the purchase of 5 new items (non-essentials) for your wardrobe. The 5 items you'd like to add would be these 5 purchases. It's a minimalist approach to style, since it pares down the wardrobe and reduces consumption - you need to plan out your choices, so you can't buy something "just because it's on sale". Another benefit is that once you've built up a french wardrobe, you don't need to put effort into planning outfits anymore - you can just pick out any combination of items to create an outfit that embodies your style. If you were happy with how this challenge went, and you like the concept of the French Wardrobe and want to read more, check out by /u/Schiaparelli, as well as by /u/jdbee and /u/Metcarfre. 
Hi FFA! I have lots and lots of scarves. They are my favorite thing. For the longest time, though, I wrapped them around my neck twice, and ended up with something that looked like every single day between October and April, every year. However, my neck didn’t always stay warm enough and the bulk of the fabric was totally in the wrong place for warmth. In today’s WAYWT (Feb 5), I explained that I’ve been experimenting with scarf tying recently, and a few people asked me to demonstrate how I tie my scarves. So I spent the better part of this afternoon avoiding homework by putting together an album of images with explanations. A tutorial of sorts, I guess. So here it is! [Welcome to /u/coastec’s wonderful world of (I suggest looking at the album on Imgur, and not in RES because the descriptions lose a little formatting and it gets muddy) I used an enormous scarf (28in x 80in, or 71cm x 203cm) in my tutorial, really only because it’s yellow and was a nice contrast against my black clothes for viewing and understanding purposes. But all my other scarves are shorter than that one, so I thought I’d mention what differs about the scarves I used in my WAYWT post. * [This purple is about the same size and weight as the yellow one in the tutorial, and I wrapped it much looser, stopping at step 12. * [This gray is a cashmere/wool blend (26in x 70in, or 66cm x 177cm). I wrapped it the same way as the tutorial, stopping at step 20. * [This is the same gray wrapped similarly to the tutorial and stopping at step 12. * [This red is a cashmere/silk blend, and significantly thicker and heavier than the yellow scarf. It’s the same size as the gray one. It’s wrapped a little tighter than the tutorial, stopping at step 20. This is just my method, and I know everyone has different preferences. So if there’s anyone who wants to share their variations on my method, or their entirely different way of tying scarves, please do! Post your thoughts, comments, constructive criticism, discussion, whatever, just talk to me about scarves please. 
I can't go check it out because the stupid receptionist is late again and I have to cover the phone. But it feels like the zipper detached from the fabric on both sides at the bottom of the zipper. What are my options?! EDIT: Thanks everyone! A mini-binder clip attached inside is doing the trick for now. Today's my anniversary and we have 7 pm dinner reservations so I'm going to try to run home and change between 5 and then so I don't have to celebrate with a binder clip stabbing me. Lesson learned, and a PSA for everyone else: KEEP A MENDING KIT AT YOUR DESK. IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU.

Hi guys! So I'm primarily a lurker to FFA but I've noticed an uptick in interest about how to incorporate punk aesthetic into a more business-approritate manner and I decided to take a crack at it because of my boss M (whose permission I have to write about her on the internet). M is a division supervisor for our contracting company, so she's kind of a big deal in our business. M was also a large player in the 1970's-1980's hardcore punk scene in DC and ran with a big crowd. *edit: a lot of people have asked me how old M is; I have to guess she's in her early 50s* M is punk to the core and would gladly come to work everyday in her lime green Doc Martens and painted leather jacket if she could, but she doesn't, and has built for herself a punk capsule work closet so she can be herself without scaring away our clients. So with her help, here is how she says punk but grown up; *Shoes:* M loves shoes and owns the largest collection of creepers I have ever seen and wears them every day, rain or shine. M is always telling me she hates heels, but creepers give her the height she wants without falling over. Her collection is expansive and well curated, from burgundy velvet, to white leather, and blue snakeskin. And in our office, which is on the more formal side of business-casual, creepers blend right in with the forest of brogues, ballet flats, and oxfords that the rest of the women wear. *Pants:* "Tight and always cropped" is what M tells me about her work pants. They are always black, grey, or navy or a plaid variation of the three. Jeans are not commonly worn in our office, and if they are, they are usually black and cropped (of course). *Shirts:* Usually M sticks with neutral button down shirts or knits that color-coordinate with her creepers (of course), but she makes a point to tell me that she tailors all of her button down shirts, being as petite as she is. *Blazers/Sweaters:* I don't think M owns a blazer or sweater that doesn't have leather or studs on them somewhere. Given the trends the last couple of seasons where leather and studs were everywhere, M keeps the embellishments minimal, but statement worthy. A blazer with leather sleeves, or a sweater with a collar of studs, for example, keep her inner punk happy as well as being appropriate for our office. *Hair/Makeup/Accessories:* I know that M would gladly dye her hair every color of the rainbow and hair spray it permanently into a mohawk, but she opts for subtle shades of red, purple, or blue in her hair (she's a dark brunette) and wears in in a faux hawk. Green eyeliner is her baby and she will never go a day not wearing it, but the trick is to not overdo it. Her jewelry is always punk rock, but again always subtle and minimal. I put together [a little inspiration album that is M so please enjoy and I hope this helped! "To me, punk rock is the freedom to create, freedom to be successful, freedom to not be successful, freedom to be who you are. It's freedom." Patti Smith 
Recently realized that I have been collecting my own private inspo album for a while and thought it might be cool to share it with you all.

**Hijab Inspiration Album Collection &amp; “Guide”** ^^I ^^am ^^by ^^no ^^means ^^an ^^Islamic ^^scholar ^^or ^^hijab ^^expert There's a lot in here, so if you're only interested in outfits, scroll on down to the bottom. This post includes one concept album and albums for abaya/jilbab, headscarf, niqab, wearing pants, wearing skits and dresses, and a tiny album for men. Also included in this post is basic information about the different types of Islamic garments and scarf styles and tips. First, here is some Islamic [architectural **What is “hijab”?** Hijab is the practice of modesty in Islam, but the concept is well known throughout many religions. Hijab translates literally to “curtain”. Modesty is perceived in terms of dress and in terms of behavior. Hijab is practiced by both men and women. All four schools of Sunni thought (Hanafi, Hanbali, Shafi’i, and Maliki) agree that for women everything but the hands and face must be covered in loose fitting clothing while in public or in prayer. There are minor difference between the schools regarding the covering of feet and when it is appropriate to cover the hands and face. **Islamic Clothing : Outerwear** *Burqa and Chador* The least common type of outerwear is the burqa or chadri. The burqa is an outer garment that covers the entire body and face, including the eyes, which are covered by a screen. There are several types of burqa. &gt;- The [Afghan ) is the most typical. It is usually [blue or ) and may have [intricate ) stitched on. &gt;- The [Omani is worn by married women in Oman, but it is very quickly dying out. &gt;- The final type is worn by [Haredi jewish in Israel. Accodring to /u/neurotrophic wearing the burqa "is practiced by a very small minority of Haredi women and by the far majority of Haredim is considered to be a violation of Jewish law". The ) is mostly worn by Iranians. It is an full length cloak that opens in the front, covers the head, leaves the face out, and is held closed by the hands. It is usually ), but can be [other as well. [*Abaya and Jilbab An abaya is a cloak. Abaya and jilbab are similar. A jilbab is like the chador, except it is closed in the front, so it does not need to be held closed. An abaya does not cover the head and it may have a belt and sleeves (making it more like a jacket than a cloak). Some styles of abaya are pulled on over the head, while others are put on like a jacket and buttoned up. **Scarf Style** [*Headscarf There are many styles of headscarf. A few common styles are: &gt;- : A two piece style that has an undercap and a pullover overscarf &gt;- : Similar in style to the Al-Amira, this scarf is only one piece. The scarf is attached to the underscarf (seen on the left). Open styles allow the scarf to be wrapped around the head, while with closed styles the scarf is already wrapped. &gt;- : This style is achieved using a silk or satin square scarf. It is pulled tight around the neck and chin. The fabric is usually pulled forward to create a “bill” over the forehead. &gt;- : This refers to styles that are loosely wrapped and show the bangs. &gt;- : This style is popular in Egypt, particularly among brides. The scarf is wrapped, like a turban, to create a bun or knot at the back or side of the head. It generally uses two or more scarves. &gt;- Turban styles are increasingly popular. [*Niqab Niqab is often confused with burqa. Niqab simply means “veil” or “mask”. Women who wear niqab cover their noses and mouths, but leave their eyes uncovered. There are several styles of niqab: &gt;- , which comes in short, medium, long, and extra long lengths and a variety of cuts. These veils have one to three layers of fabric which you can flip over to cover the back of your head, or leave in the front to keep your eyes screened. &gt;- In addition to this, the eye window comes in different shapes and with or without a &gt;- One layer flip niqabs with zippers down the middle, for ease of eating, are up and coming. &gt;- [Half do not cover the eyebrows. &gt;- The other type of niqab is made with a scarf, like Since it is a headscarf, it can be tied in a variety of ways. *Things to Consider* When wearing a scarf, you should take into consideration your face shape. Some styles look better on certain face shapes than others. &gt;- Oval face : wear any style &gt;- Long face: try styles which come further down on the forehead like this &gt;- Round face : Avoid styles that cut across the forehead, such as those that need underscarves/caps; instead wear styles that are loose and flowy, such as &gt;- Square face : Combine styles for rectangle and round faces! Loose styles that have a rounded top at the hairline will lengthen the face, as you can see &gt;- Heart face : Instead of adding volume at the top, emphasis the chin by pinning your scarf close and tight to your jawline, such as with the [turkish style If you have afro-hair cotton, chiffon, and polyester fabrics are liable to break off your hair or really thin out your edges if you wear them too often. Headscarves are not limited to Muslim women. Christian, Jewish, Sikh, and other religions have women who cover their hair. Non-religious individuals cover their hair all the time as well. **Hijabi Style** [*Hijabis Wearing [*Hijabis Wearing Dresses and Also, make sure to check out [these from /u/verythehensem , which focus on fashion in Malaysia and Indonesia. **What about the Men?** [*Here you Hijab for men requires covering at least from “navel to knee” in loose fitting clothing and covering the hair when in prayer. Like with womens’ dress, the schools of thought differ in some aspects of mens’ hijab. &gt;- Many believe that pants should not cover the ankle and that men should not wear red. &gt;- Debates continue about tucking in shirts, as some think that makes shirts tight-fitting. A well groomed beard is also highly recommended, by all schools. 
I was inspired by [this only I wanted to reframe the conversation. What's starting to or about to come into style where you live? I'm curious what you've noticed as bleeding edge fashion. Do you like it? **Edit** Removed my example because I don't want to color the discussion too much :) Put in the comments as a reference 
I love looking through magazines like Lucky and InStyle that show trendy clothes that range from super expensive to super affordable. I'm curious what a similar spread looks like in countries across the world right now.

Ok this is not a major deal for me seeing how I live in NYC and am surrounded by H&amp;M's, but I'm so excited to see that their website to shop at is finally up and running! Yay! that is all.

Also if you're asking for advice make sure you give enough information so people can help. Maybe if you don't have any specific questions you can offer tips/advice/YSK/FYI etc. that you might think is useful but you haven't been able to spread that wisdom somewhere else.

After struggling with a mother-of-the-groom dress that I ordered through a dressmaker — including five fittings and hundreds of FFA comments — I finally decided on a different dress altogether! In frustration I stopped by Nordstrom's and tried on a few things off the rack. One gray lace dress looked pretty good so I took it home and modeled it for the family. Everyone clearly preferred it to my original idea: [here's a (sans Spanx — that will come!). Luckily I hadn't yet removed the unfortunate sleeves of the first dress — I'll leave that to the next owner if she wants to. :-) Thank you so much for your help!

I came to MFA full of frustration. I dreaded getting dressed. I owned plenty of clothing, but nothing fit, nothing went together, and nothing flattered me. For years, I wore jeans, sneakers, black v-neck tees, and the occasional buttondown for work. My style goal was - at best - to simply blend in. Then I found MFA. Inspired by /u/jdbee's essential [The Basic Wardrobe I promptly went out and spent too much money in malls. I had more clothing, but still only one or two outfits that really gelled - and still nothing that was particularly flattering. It still didn't feel like *me* - I was at the mercy of whatever was in stock and whatever fit. Too often, I'd bring something home, spend an hour trying it on, and realize I have nothing else to go with it. I had a closet full of clothes, *and absolutely nothing to wear*. So, I put a moratium on new purchases, and started reading. I built a deeper understanding of the *concepts* - fit, fabrics, the difference between a bomber, a harrington, and a varsity. I found my taste - I knew what I liked when I saw it. And yet - I still didn't have the practical skills to buy and wear clothing well. It was around this time I learned about capsule wardrobes, and read the perfection that is /u/Schiaparelli's [French Wardrobe I had to get systematic - every purchase had to count - and here's what I came up with. **TLDR**: [Here's the if you're the impatient type **WARNING**: This guide relies heavily on Photoshop, but that's just me. You could use scissors and glue if that's more your speed. **DISCLAIMER**: I'm no fashionista, I'm just a frustrated guy who knows what he likes. Most people won't have the patience or need for this process. But if you have struggled like I have, and have too much free time - read on. ***** **1. What should be in your wardrobe?** ***** I see amazing fits in the WAYWT - but I know most of them aren't for me. Even if I could pull it off (a nice suit), there might not be a place for it in my life (a nice suit). I had to start being honest - brutally honest - about my needs, my preferences, and my limitations. **Needs** * I live in Southern California. It's hot here. I also spend several weeks a year in the Pacific Northwest, where it's usually rainy and chilly. My wardrobe has to work for both. * I work from home, but I'm in a low-key office when I'm in the PNW. No dress code - and I could get away with T-shirts - but it's nice to have sharp biz-casual options. * I like to go see live music and comedy. I don't go to clubs, I don't play sports, and the only time I ever need to wear suit is when someone dies. **Preferences** * I like white, black, blue, gray, khaki, and brown. * I don't like to stand out with loud colors or patterns. Flannel and burgundy is about as wild as I get. * I grew up a 90s grunge kid, but secretly I love a refined streetwear look. **Limitations** * I have big thighs and front-mount junk. It is difficult to find pants that don't flare at the "saddlebags" or bunch up at the crotch. * I have broad shoulders and a relatively narrow waist. I sit right on the cusp between Medium and Large, right on the cusp of Standard and Slim. I'm not fat, but I am wide. * I have a thick neck. Most crew necks are out. The top button on a dress shirt will suffocate me. ["The second button literally makes or break the About limitations - ouch. It's taken a long time to come terms with the body I have - but it's the one I've got, and it'll do. I wish I could be a skinny-jeans punk rocker, but I'm not - so whatever I wear better look on *me*. Alright, so you've faced the harsh realities of your life. What's next? ***** **2. Find a pair of pants and a shirt that look really, really good on you** ***** Easier said than done, at least for me. I have tried on literally hundreds of pairs of jeans, and been happy with maybe a dozen of them. Some people can buy the first pair of Levi's they try on. I can't. Most shirts off the rack simply do not fit. OH WELL. There's no excuse - you just have to keep trying until you find that perfect fit. Don't buy anything until you find it. If you don't live near many stores, then get yourself an Amazon Prime account and get used to returning things. For some people this is trivial, but for me it was heartbreaking. It is exhausting to spend all day at a mall with nothing to show for it. It's a pain in the ass to order five pairs of pants online then drive to UPS the next day to return them all. But trust me - it's worth it. When you finally slip on that perfect pair of pants, it's like winning the lottery. Don't settle for less. Eventually, I found these: * Dockers Slim Alpha Chino in 33x32 * An Old Navy OCBD in Medium - go figure, but this thing fits PERFECT Alright! I might only have one outfit, and it might be real basic - but it works. More than that - I have now have a standard. **EVERYTHING I BUY FROM THIS POINT SHOULD LOOK AT LEAST AS GOOD AS THESE.** In the meantime, I've learned quite a bit about what fits me. Banana Republic Slim Fit Medium works for me. Nothing at J. Crew does. I fall through the gap at Uniqlo - Medium is too small, Large is too large (story of my life). If I have to wear Levi's, then 522 is closest but the rise is a bit high for my taste. Crew neck sweaters look goofy on me. Dope kicks, despite being a pasty whiteboy, actually kind of work. ***** **3. Design your wardrobe** ***** Now we get to the fun part, and the real work of this guide. We're going to take a couple core pieces, and build a wardrobe around them. **Choose two items to "seed" your wardrobe** Fall is here (although you wouldn't necessarily know it here in SoCal), and I decided the core for my autumn/winter fashion for this year will be dark denim (a pair of [Unbranded that fit as well as my Alpha chinos) and a [lightweight technical bomber from It's clean, subtle, dark, and can be dressed up or down - that's my jam. So, I fired up Photoshop and made a new 1024 x 768 image. I downloaded pictures of my two items, sized them to fit, dropped them in on the left, and [ended up with This will be my template for the next steps. **Pick a theme and build some boards** With these basics in place, I thought about what I might wear with these 1. [Textured - Things I could wear to the office or a low-key night out. This is definitely my comfort zone, so seemed like a good place to start. Flannel and leather figure prominently, and that gray shirt on the end is corduroy. 2. - I love blacks and grays, but ideally with some texture or detail. You can't see on the buttondown, but it's a "micro-houndstooth" that looks very interesting in person. Pair it with a boring rain shell and a selection of kicks. 3. [Interesting - For the record, I _never_ wear printed t-shirts, but I thought it would be a fun exercise to try some out. Also it's easy to find pictures of them on the internet. Fun, yeah? Lots of practice building complete, interchangeable wardrobes - a skill I was desperately lacking in. My workflow looked like this: 1. Find a picture of the item laid flat against a solid background 2. Right-click on it (in Chrome) and select "Copy image" (which puts the image itself in your clipboard) 3. Paste it into a new layer in Photoshop 4. Resize it so it all fits in the image 5. Use the Magic Wand tool with a low tolerance (0-20) to select and delete the background 6. Resize it to scale and put it in position Sometimes it's tough to get at the actual image file. "View Larger", "Go Fullscreen", and Snipping Tool (i.e. screenshots) are helpful. If that doesn't work, the following can be used in Chrome: * Hit Ctrl-Shift-J to open up the Developer Tools * Click the "Resources" tab * Expand the "Frames" folder, then any subfolder(s) under "Frames" * Expand the "Images" item * Find your desired image, click the "URL" link, then you should be set to "Copy Image" as normal Some guidelines: * Have fun and don't try to get it perfect. * Limit yourself to interesting pieces. Assume you will always have plain white/gray/black tees. * You won't be able to find a good picture of most items. It doesn't have to be that EXACT pair of jeans - just get the vibe right. * Not all retailers have suitable pictures. Uniqlo, Banana Republic, H&amp;M, Zara are featured heavily for that reason. ***** **4. Purchasing (i.e. get ready to be disappointed)** ***** Alright, now you just buy all of the items you picked out, look great, and find happiness, right? Ha! Just because it looks good in Photoshop does not mean it'll work in real life. It might not fit, it might be too expensive, it might be sold out, or it might just not good when you're actually wearing it with your core items. Also, I had three different themes there - while they're all internally-consistent, they might clash against each other. No, all I have now are *ideas*. I have a mission statement. Now, when I go shopping, I'm not just going to find something that fits and take it home. Either I find: * A light gray corduroy buttondown * A subtle blue-purple dobby flannel * An aqua blue patterned tee that isn't too garish ..or I'm going home empty handed. This kind of shopping, to be honest, works much better online than at a mall. Embrace the return policy. BE RUTHLESS. It might be perfect, but if it doesn't fit as well as my Alpha chinos or Old Navy OCBD, I'm not buying it. That isn't to say it has to fit the *same* - it just has to be at least as flattering to your body. ***** **5. Reality** ***** Of the 28 pieces I included in my boards, I've bought four of them. Four! I might buy two more over the course of this Autumn/Winter. That's the idea behind French Wardrobe - five new items per season. But the pieces I did buy - I love them. They fit, they work with everything I own, they have that special something that makes me look like I know what I'm doing. Because I bought so few items, I was able to buy more expensive items, stuff with great attention to detail that should last me at least another year or two. With each new item I found, they became part of the "core". The next boards I make will definitely include them - and everything I buy ought to work with them. To be honest - I'm still a jeans, kicks, and v-neck kind of guy. But I don't hate myself every time I get dressed, and now I have *options*. Alright folks - that's it. Question, comments and concerns much appreciated. 
I have always loved gwen stefanis style. She does an amazing job at layering and pairing different prints and textures together in unexpected ways. She isn't afraid to rock a more masculine silhouette and her accessories and shoes are always so cute! Id say her style leans towards punk but with a feminine touch at times. I thought this would be a great inspiration album for the women out there who like to wear loose clothing but have a tough time making it look feminine and not looking like they are drowning in the fabric. In some of the pictures she's wearing really trendy pieces but she still sticks to her overall style, which just goes to show you that you can be on trend while still maintaining your signature look. 
So I'm sure most of you have all heard about this "French Wardrobe" business by now (if not, scroll down to the FAQ at the bottom!). Perhaps you've thought to yourself, "That's a cool idea, but I'm not sure that it'll work for me", or maybe, "I'll try that once I finish purchasing all of these basic essentials". Well, this challenge for everyone who has been putting off trying the French Wardrobe, as well as those that want to try it out! Give it a shot - you might be surprised with the results! --- *The Challenge* **Step 1:** Pick out your 5 favorite tops (tees, henleys, polos, OCBDs, etc.) and your 5 favorite bottoms (jeans, chinos, shorts, etc.). **Hard mode:** If this isn't actually a challenge for you, limit yourself even further! Maybe only allow yourself 3 shirts and 3 pairs of pants, or place a limit on your other clothing items. **Hardcore mode:** Choose any 25 pieces, in whatever quantities you like. You can wear only those 25 pieces for the next 25 days. this excludes underwear/loungewear/socks (if they're not visible, they don't count.) **Step 2:** I hope you're comfortable in these clothes, since these 10 pieces are what you're going to be wearing for about the next 25 days! From these 10 items alone, you have 25 potential outfits already, not counting the variety that your outerwear, footwear and accessories will generate. The challenge is in seeing how you can use these 10 pieces as the basis for your outfits over the next month - you might be surprised at how many different outfits you can create! **Step 3:** Take a picture every day, and in about a month, report back to the submission thread and let us know what you've learned. What outfits worked? Did you realize that a certain piece was more versatile than you expected? Did you find yourself wishing for a certain kind of piece that would've filled a hole in your limited wardrobe? Were you comfortable wearing the same clothes every day? Do you think the French Wardrobe is right for you? --- *The Rules* * You have 5 (or less) tops (tees, henleys, polos, OCBDs, etc.) and 5 (or less) bottoms (jeans, chinos, shorts, etc.) to use as a basis for your outfits. * You can supplement these base items with whatever outerwear, footwear, accessories you have with no limit. Remember, the spirit of the challenge is to see how much you can make out of a limited wardrobe. It doesn't really count if you wear 10 different cardigans over 2 buttondown shirts. * If you wear clothes in public, your outfit must consist of one top and one bottom from the ten items you've chosen. 	* Exception I: if you're not wearing clothes (i.e. wearing underwear/loungewear/staying inside all day), just skip that day and continue on with the challenge the next day. 	* Exception II: if your work wardrobe is drastically different from your casual wardrobe, pick either one to apply this challenge to, and ignore the other. * You don't have to wear each top with each bottom. Though the spirit is to try and create as many different outfits as possible, it's okay to re-wear a particular combination. * Take pictures every day! We don't want to just listen to you talk about what you've learned, we want to see pics, even if all you have is a potato and a grimy mirror. * **Post in this thread:** What pieces you're limiting yourself to, what additional restrictions you're throwing in, and what you expect to see in the next 25 days! --- *FAQ:* What's the French Wardrobe? &gt; Here's the elevator pitch: The French Wardrobe is a style philosophy that is based on having a wardrobe full of curated, versatile basics that fit your own personal style. Each season, you limit yourself by planning out the purchase of 5 new items (non-essentials) for your wardrobe. &gt;It's a minimalist approach to style, since it pares down the wardrobe and reduces consumption - you need to plan out your choices, so you can't buy something "just because it's on sale". Another benefit is that once you've built up a french wardrobe, you don't need to put effort into planning outfits anymore - you can just pick out any combination of items to create an outfit that embodies your style. &gt;If you want to read more, check out by /u/Schiaparelli, as well as by /u/jdbee and /u/Metcarfre. Wearing the same thing over and over again? Won't people think I'm weird? &gt; Don't worry about it! Trust me, people don't really notice or care about what you wear as much as you do. So long as you aren't wearing the exact same outfit every day for a month straight, they won't notice. Plus, part of the fun of this challenge is to see how you can wear your pieces in new ways! 
[Last week we announced Show us your inner self! 
So you're going on a trip and for whatever reason (access to luggage, vehicle space limitations, desire to experiment with a capsule wardrobe, taking personal offense at the idea of paying $25 to check a bag, etc) you need to pack for several weeks in a carry on. Here are some tips to help you do that. First, some requirements: 1. Have access to laundry facilities at your destination(s) 2. Be content with a capsule-ish wardrobe 3. PRIORITIZE and make some compromises (mine was that my casual wardrobe would suffer slightly. Half of my trip was for an internship in a warm climate where I needed to dress biz-caz. This did not leave room for some of my more interesting winter layering options) 4. If travelling for the holidays: **ship your gifts!** 5. Wear layers of your bulkiest items while in transit. 6. Pack smart! See album below for a visual guide on how to actually pack your suitcase. Here is my packing list. Given how I choose to dress this may or may not be particularly useful for you, but the important thing is that you're able to create an acceptable number of outfits from as few pieces as possible. * 6 work shirts (OCBDs) * 2 pairs of chinos (**important: all shirt/chino combinations work well together, which gives me 12 outfits**) * Appropriate quantities of underthings * Appropriate quantities of Ts (I have 4 undershirts, 4 gym shirts, 6 "regular" Ts) * 1 pair work-appropriate shoes * 1 pair sweatpants, 2 pair gym shorts, 1 pair gym shoes Wearing list: * T shirt * Flannel * Hoodie * Fleece * Jeans * Sneakers [Album showing the actual packing - this shows how I packed all these items into one bag, and nothing required ironing when I unpacked. **Two last notes:** 1: All your other miscellaneous stuff goes in your "personal item" which can usually be pretty big. 2: Gate-checking is awesome - you can get away with a much larger carry-on than what will actually fit in the bins above the seats. *Edited like 15 times to figure out formatting* 
We have plenty of Business Casual resources in this sub, but most are broad and offer guidelines that leave some of us even more confused. I wanted to write this guide for those of you that want to look professional and presentable but don't have the time to do the leg-work, or don't care to browse or shop until you find something that's acceptable. If one of the following applies to you, then you are in the right place and I hope this guide is helpful: * You are young &amp; starting your first professional job that requires a biz caz dress code, your hobbies don't include fashion but you want to look professional &amp; current at work. * You don’t care much for fashion in general but you need presentable clothes for work. You want to show your coworkers &amp; boss that you're capable of being dressed appropriately for any situation, even if an unexpected client shows up. * You've got your weekend-style down, and it's totally not appropriate for your conservative-leaning workplace. You just want a quick &amp; easy wardrobe that is functional but not fussy. **Dress Code** This guide will adhere to the following dress code because it’s very general and common for most business casual/corporate casual work places: * Skirts &amp; dress at or below the knee * Pants below the knee (no shorts) * No spaghetti straps * No open-toe shoes * Casual Friday is observed Some notes: 1. Your particular office may have different guidelines so please adjust as needed. Your office may allow sandals, so feel free to substitute sandals for pumps. Or you may have a conservative office that does not allow sleeveless tops so substitute with short sleeves. Bear in mind that I’m trying to provide general &amp; broad guidelines here. 2. Casual Friday does **not** mean that you can throw all guidelines out the window. You should still observe your office dress code. I view casual Friday as permission to wear jeans instead of a pencil skirt or trouser. So don’t wear your neon-green body con dress. Acutally, don't even wear your black body-con dress even though it was in the "work wear" section at H&amp;M. So, to get started: First, determine the dress code of your office: [The Formality Level of Your Office or by /u/thethirdsilence is a good starting point. Then read these Business Casual guides in case they answer your questions: * This [Business by /u/thethirdsilence * And [Business Casual for Interns &amp; New by /u/aktuarie **The Minimal Business Casual Wardrobe** I have found that each season you can get by with about 3-5 bottoms (skirts &amp; pants), 10 tops (blouses, tees, sweaters, etc.), 2 cardigans or blazers, and 2-3 shoes. You’ll do laundry about every 2 weeks. If you want to/prefer to/are able to do laundry every week, you could get by with less: 3 bottoms, 5 tops, 1 cardigan or blazer, 2-3 shoes. I find it easier to work on a 2-week cycle because things come up during the weekend and laundry time is not guaranteed. I also want to touch briefly on color. The most successful colors in a minimalist wardrobe are neutrals: white, navy, black, taupe, gray, and cream. Then there are the colors that are close enough to neutrals that work well: maroon or oxblood, light blue, dark green, and light or dusty pink. It becomes more difficult to incorporate accent colors because they stand out so much, and thus don’t just blend into your wardrobe. Without further ado, here’s a minimal business casual wardrobe for a low budget (generally less than $50 per piece) &amp; and a mid budget (about $50-$150 per piece). Please free to provide additional advice in the comments as well as critique. **Lower Budget** * [Polyvore link to lower budget * [10 * Total Cost = $658 **Mid Budget** * [Polyvore link to the mid budget * [10 * Total Cost = $1971 Store Links: offers generally low prices. offers low priced &amp; trendy items. &amp; [J.Crew has frequent discounts &amp; sales.

A few months ago, at the recommendation of many members (and desperately needing some new panties), I ordered the 7 for $25 or whatever of the aerie underwear, feeling OK about it because: a) people here seem to like them b) they are cheap, so even if *I* don't, it's not too big of a financial hit c)As a nearly 30 year old woman, I can order online, vs *actually walking into an American Eagle*. I got a variety of cuts and fabrics, and I have to tell you ladies, these are the most comfortable, cutest underpants I've had as an adult. The girl shorts and boy briefs are my favorite. The cotton ones are fine, but the lacy ones are *great*. When I run them through the hand wash cycle with my other delicates, then hang them to dry, they are dry so quickly that I can wear them the next morning. They also are super thin, so except for the thinnest and sheerest fabrics, even cheek-cutting lines aren't visible. Also, maybe it's just a chubby-girl thing, but when sitting in the car on a long road trip, I often get weird creases in my underwear that dig into my butt, and they are very uncomfortable. Didn't happen with these panties. I was mildly concerned that the sizing may run small (based on comments that I read on FFA), but I stuck with my measurements, and the sizing ran true to what I usually wear, and they are not too tight. A heads-up though - a few months ago, I got some gorgeous lacy things, and they're solid colored. The most recent batch I got have silvery lacy lines around the legs and top. I wish they didn't, but they're not ugly or anything. I just want to thank you all for the suggestion, this *actually* impacted my quality of life. I recently got all new bras after learning about correct sizing over at r/abrathatfits and now I love *all* of my undergarments. 
Last Thursday we announced the theme, and today is the day for submissions! is a link to the announcement thread if you missed it. Post your fits below! 
OK, I tried to post this yesterday but I don't think it worked - so here it is again. I really enjoyed the recent epic ['Pants: A however by her own admission didn't include "yoga pants, track pants, running leggings, etc." My offer to do a post on just that issue was quite popular, so here it is. Disclaimer: though I used to work for an outdoors/fitness retailer I'm by no means an expert. I hope you'll all 'well, actually' me in the comments, add things I missed and ask questions. **Know your activity** This is vital. Is it high or low impact? How much will you sweat? Will your effort level be constant, or are you taking breaks? In what ways will your body be moving? Will you be outside? If so, what are weather conditions like? **Materials** In the fitness world, material is king. Most workout clothes contain one or more of four main materials: cotton, polyester, nylon and elastane/spandex. Check the label (or product details if you're shopping online) to see in what proportions they appear in a garment. These are the starting point for working out what sort of activity that garment is suitable for. 1. **Cotton**: natural, breathable, soft against the skin. Absorbs moisture easily and doesn't dry quickly - not great for a very sweaty activity. Not as durable as synthetic fibres, so won't take regular washing well. Can also get stinky. 2. **Polyester**: not as breathable, but dries much quicker than cotton. Has excellent 'wicking' properties (i.e. brings moisture to the surface of the garment where it can easily evaporate). 3. **Nylon**: similar to polyester in its wicking properties, but generally stretchier. The fibres are smooth, so dirt won't stick to them easily. Doesn't 'pill' even with heavy wear and washing. 4. **Elastane/Spandex** (name varies by region): gives the garment streeeeetch! Very important if it's form fitting, to ensure you have freedom of movement. 5. **You may also meet**: *bamboo* - similar feel to cotton but better wicking and anti-bacterial properties; *rayon* - strong, absorbent, silky feel, may stretch when wet; *merino wool* - not generally used in straight-up workout clothes but popular with outdoors types, keeps you warm in winter and cool in summer, great wicking properties, nice feel against the skin, amazing anti-bacterial properties so you can wear it on consecutive days without smelling. **Fit** 1. **Compression/Tight**: probably best if you're going to be doing a lot of fast and/or repetitive movement, for example running or cycling. Tight-fitting garments are preferred by many runners because they stop skin rubbing against skin. Also, there's no excess material to bunch up and get in the way. Useful for classes where a teacher needs to see and correct your form (e.g. yoga, dance). Garments labelled as 'compression' will often claim to improve circulation or quicken recovery times, but I'm not sure how much evidence there is to actually back these up. 2. **Loose**: preferred by many for slower-moving and lower-impact activities. If you're not worried about chafing, you may find it's more comfortable and provides freedom of movement. Also a little more 'modest' for those of you not wishing to wear something skin-tight. 3. **Baggy**: usually best kept as warm-up or warm-down garments, worn over something else and removed when you really get going. See the guide to layering below. **Sizing** Be aware that many brands specialising in fitness or outdoor gear have different fits depending on the type of garment. Patagonia is a good example: they have [four different - form, slim, regular and relaxed. If you can, check the exact measurements of the garment. Watch out for 'compression' garments - these are extremely snug! **Temperature** 1. **Sweating**: not dignified, but vital. The more you're sweating, the less you'll want the absorbency of cotton and the more you'll need the wicking properties of polyester or nylon. For example: most yoga pants contain some cotton, while tights intended for running almost never do. 2. **Cold weather**: in activities with changing effort levels, if the weather is cool you'll need to stay warm to avoid cramps - this is when track pants and other thicker bottom layers come in handy. If you're wearing a cotton garment outside and it gets wet you will feel chilly. 3. **Hot weather**: a good time for looser garments, as sweat will wick most effectively straight off your skin. **Layering** Over time, you'll get to know your own preferences for how much you wear dependent on activity and weather. Here's a basic layering system to get you started. 1. **Underwear**, e.g. sports bra: I'm an advocate of going commando under tight/compression garments where possible, as it reduces chafing. However if you want to wear underwear, just stay away from cotton - it will trap a layer of moisture inside your baselayer and be very uncomfortable. Underwear of the top and bottom varieties made of synthetic materials with good wicking properties are widely available. 2. **Base**, e.g. t-shirt, capri tights: follow the materials guide above to see what suits your activity. 3. **Mid**, e.g. thin fleece jacket: worn over the baselayer. Mostly used for extra insulation in cold weather. 4. **Shell**, e.g. waterproof jacket: outer layer. Generally called a 'soft shell' if it's only water *resistant*, or 'hard shell' if it's water *proof*. This is an extremely complicated topic for another post - suffice it to say here that the battle is how to make a material that's resistant to water while allowing moisture (sweat) to escape. Pertex is preferable for strenuous activities as it's light and breathable; if you want something more waterproof and don't mind that it's heavier and less breathable, try Gore-Tex (edit: or eVent, which uses similar technology but is more breathable -thanks for pointing this out). **Buying** 1. **Price**: when it comes to fitness and outdoors gear you're paying for durability, both in terms of solid construction and quality materials. If you're only a once-a-week gym attender this doesn't matter, but everyday exercisers will wear and wash their gear *a lot*. 2. **Brands**: I have my own favourite brands, but I won't recommend specifics here because it's a very personal choice. There are so many factors to consider; it's a process of trial and error to find what works for you. 3. **Where to go**: a good place to start is by visiting your local sports our outdoors store (e.g. REI). Don't be intimidated - we see all sorts of people every day; you absolutely do not have to be a size 4 to buy workout clothes. Make a note of what brands they carry and then keep your eyes open for those at discount warehouses and online. Or support your local business if you can afford to! :) Well, I hope this is useful and not too patronising and/or mind-boggling. Let the questions begin...

Decided to put together an album that relies on gray, black, and white clothing. I'm especially in love with gray at the moment. This album is a lot different than the one I posted last year. Funny how our fashion taste can change in such a small amount of time! I will say, because of some of the lighting, it's hard to tell if a few pieces of clothing are black or a really dark navy. Kind of just went with my gut on those. Enjoy!

*Originally created for FFA, so forgive the sea of lipstick and dress examples herein. All of the principles here apply across genders.* If you were alive in the 1980s or had a mother who was, you are probably familiar with the concept of having a “season” (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) based on your personal coloring, which determined which colors you can and can’t wear. And if you’ve gotten further into this concept via fashion magazines or [Into you may have tried earnestly to analyze the color of your veins or the brightness of your eyes, to varying degrees of success, and probably some confusion. This guide will take you further into the concepts of personal color analysis (“PCA”) and try to alleviate some of that confusion. **Why would I want to know my colors?** I feel like I should start with an important disclaimer: *I am not here to tell you what colors you are and aren’t allowed to wear.* Many people don’t care about PCA, don’t “believe” in it (as if it’s some variant of astrology), or just aren’t interested in taking their natural coloring into account when they dress. That is completely fair and valid. Like the [dressing for your guide, this is intended to help you understand the concepts of PCA and use them if you want. With that out of the way, there are a lot of reasons to want to wear colors that harmonize with your natural coloring: * It can make you look younger and healthier * It can put people visually at ease when they see you, helping to garner subconscious trust and respect * It can give you a framework for building a wardrobe of colors that all harmonize with *you* and therefore also with each other * Knowing your season can help you avoid buying things that you later feel like you don’t look good in * Knowing your season can suggest to you colors that would look great on you that you haven’t thought of before, or don’t tend to stumble across in stores **Characteristics of color** Let’s define some terms that will help us put colors into groups for the purposes of PCA. First, a color can be light or dark. This refers to how close it is to either white or black. Pretty straightforward. Here’s a [light and here’s a [dark Also, a color can be warm or cool. In PCA, this refers to how much yellow (warm) or blue (cool) is in it. You may be familiar with this concept from shopping for red lipstick. Here is a [warm and here is a [cool IMPORTANT NOTE: There is a spectrum of warmth and coolness within every color. Even yellow and blue themselves: * [Warm vs. [cool * [Warm vs. [cool Finally, a color can be bright or muted. This refers to how saturated the color is compared to gray. Brightness/mutedness is not the same as lightness/darkness. Muted and bright colors can be either light or dark. When you think “muted,” think “more gray.” Here is a [bright and here is a [more muted pink of a similar **Why are you talking so much about colors? Tell me my undertone.** Ok, so you may have heard the term “undertone” or taken a quiz online that tries to match up your hair, eye, vein and jewelry color to a particular season. I don’t think this is particularly helpful, for a lot of reasons including the following: 1. You can’t “see” undertone. Even if you try to guess by examining your veins, there are a lot of factors that will make them look blue or purple or green (green compared to what?) aside from your undertone. Like how light or dark your skin is, where on your body you’re looking, and what you’re comparing them to. 2. By all accounts, most people’s undertone is neutral, leaning very slightly warm or cool. So if you examine your attributes (blue veins, brown eyes, tan easily, look good in gold, WTF?) you are likely to get a pretty mixed bag. 3. Arbitrary attributes are hard to set boundaries around in words. What is blonde hair? Obviously is blonde, and so is but is How about If you try to determine your season solely by your attributes, you may get frustrated just defining what those attributes are. 4. How your attributes look varies based on what colors are surrounding them right now. That’s kind of the whole point! So it’s hard to look in the mirror, or look at a photo, and see objectively where your personal coloring falls on the three scales described above. Though there are certainly common patterns in the attributes of different seasons, the attributes are not the definition. Every season contains a wide variety of different hair colors, eye colors and ethnicities. The best way to talk about types of personal coloring is in terms of *what colors look harmonious on them*. **The 12 seasons** Contemporary PCA divides coloring into twelve seasons (listed here in order of adjacency)… * [**True looks most harmonious in colors that are cool, medium-to-very bright and medium-to-very dark. * [**Bright looks most harmonious in colors that are bright, medium-to-very dark and slightly cool. * [**Bright looks most harmonious in colors that are bright, medium darkness and slightly warm. * [**True looks most harmonious in colors that are warm, medium-to-very bright and medium darkness. * [**Light looks most harmonious in colors that are light, medium brightness and slightly warm. * [**Light looks most harmonious in colors that are light, low-to-medium brightness and slightly cool. * [**True looks most harmonious in colors that are cool, medium brightness and medium darkness. * [**Soft looks most harmonious in colors that are muted, medium darkness and slightly cool. * [**Soft looks most harmonious in colors that are muted, medium darkness and slightly warm. * [**True looks most harmonious in colors that are warm, medium-to-very dark and medium brightness. * [**Dark looks most harmonious in colors that are dark, medium-to-very bright and slightly warm. * [**Dark looks most harmonious in colors that are dark, medium brightness and slightly cool. **What is ‘harmony’?** Put a color near your face, and look at your face (not the color). What do you observe? A harmonious color seems to look like it “belongs” to your face, like nature dressed you that way. Everything looks normal and nothing looks distorted. Sometimes it’s easier to recognize signs of disharmony, which can include: * Blotchy or uneven looking skin tone * Emphasized redness in the skin * Emphasized yellowness in the skin * Emphasized shadows or dark undereye circles * A grayish pallor * Your skin taking on the same hue as the color you’re holding up * An effect where your eyes are drawn to the color you’re holding, rather than your face Not sure what you’re seeing? Hold up a different color, and observe any changes. Better or worse? Different? Different how? The above experiment is easiest to judge in natural light, without makeup on, and in the most neutral-colored environment you can create. **So how can I determine my season?** It sounds kind of tautological, but the best way to determine which colors look good on you is to test which colors look good on you. You can either do the above, many many times, with a huge array of different colors, or you can see a certified professional color analyst to do just that for you. They call it “draping,” and it’s a lot like when you go to the eye doctor and they have you sit down without glasses on and try to read things under various settings, asking you “1… or 2? 3… or 4?” and gradually narrowing it down versus just asking you a bunch of questions about what glasses you like to wear and then proclaiming that you’re a -1.75. There are some advantages to having this done professionally as opposed to experimenting yourself over many hours or years. One of them is that a color analyst will usually have a tightly controlled environment - pure neutral gray room, neutral gray robe, full spectrum lights - that will let you do this experimenting in a way that controls for confusing factors. Another is that an analyst will have calibrated drapes of a full array of colors that are matched to the different seasons, that accurately represent the different color characteristics, and that may be different than what you are able to find in a retail environment or your own closet at any given time. **That sounds expensive and time consuming, how can I determine my season myself, today?** Ok, do you have an hour to kill and access to a MAC counter and a patient friend? [Here are some to figuring out your season that may or may not work for you, but at least are a better proxy than trying to figure it out based on your hair color. A couple of things to keep in mind if you try to go the quick DIY route: If you take that quiz at the bottom of the page I linked, follow the instructions and have someone else take it for you. Remember that the names of colors - even really specific-sounding ones like *fuschia* or *beige* - can encompass a wide variety of different actual colors that may or may not look good on you. Not every makeup recommendation within a given season will be ideal for you, given the ranges of color characteristics within a season and the fact that colors you wear *on* your face need to be a bit more particular than those you wear in clothes, plus the fact that people have different tastes in makeup irrespective of what is just harmonious. **Can you tell me my season? Here are some photos.** No, and it should be obvious why not if you’ve read this far. Even if people could tell you your season just by looking at you, photography itself and the display of photos on different screens will alter the colors we’re looking at anyway. You will need to experiment. **I dyed my hair. What season am I now?** A different hair color won’t change your natural season, but it might make clothes and makeup look different on you. Especially if your new hair color *isn’t* ideal for your coloring, it can make the colors that would otherwise look harmonious on you look off. A different hair color may make it easier to “borrow” colors from other seasons on the spectrum, but it will not make you a different season. **Does my season change if I have a tan?** No. But you may find that you prefer different colors in your palette (especially for makeup) when your skin is darker or lighter. **But I already know what looks good on me!** Like I said at the outset, you are free to wear whatever colors you want. But I will say that people tend to be extremely non-objective when it comes to judging their most harmonious colors. A lot of us have gone through life with some deeply held convictions (or statements made by others) about what does and doesn’t look good on us, which are easy to internalize over the long term. In addition, you probably have a color palette that you *tend* to wear for the purposes of wardrobe cohesiveness (or in alignment with current color trends), and it can be easy to conflate “what I usually wear” with “what looks best on me.” Finally, many people have immediate aesthetic reactions to colors based on their “hanger appeal” that have little to nothing to do with how harmonious the color is with our actual skin. The colors that look best on you might not be the ones you gravitate to in a store, or the ones that make your friends go “I looove that sweater!” **What if I hate my season or love colors I’m not supposed to wear?** It’s important to remember that every season has a wide-ranging palette. If you do subscribe to and care about PCA, it’s not like you’re only allowed to wear four colors and all others are verboten. Think of your palette like a lens through which you look at color (how bright? how warm? how dark?) rather than a list of approved colors. You might look horrible in one company's "oxblood" but really good in someone else's "maroon," and it all comes down to slight differences in hue, darkness and saturation. **Suggestions for Further Reading** Pretty much an endless trove of insight on PCA. Check out the “celebrities” sections under each season for great examples of harmonious vs. non-harmonious colors on various faces. 
So I was relaxing in the bath, reading the most recent J. Crew catalog, when I noticed [this gem of an for [this And it REALLY upset me. I'm far from being an ethical consumer, but it just seemed blatantly awful that they're advertising that a garment that sells for $138 has eight HOURS of hand-detailing in it. There's no *way* you can do that and pay your workers decently. (This sweater hails from the mythical land of 'Imported.' If you produced this in the States, for example, and paid a worker $7.25/hour to do the same work, 40% of the garment's price would be tying the tassels. And of course, the retail price is marked up from the wholesale cost and so on, so there's absolutely no way you could do this anywhere but in a low-wage setting.) There's a page further on in the catalog which claims that a sweater takes three days to knit by hand-- yup, also just for $138. C'mon. It's not like clothing companies haven't always been outsourcing, cost-slashing, and corner-cutting since the dawn of time, but it seems *really* bad taste for J. Crew to spin it as a selling point, advertised so brazenly. I usually forget about ethics and buy from whoever I want, but it's awfully hard to stay complacent when exploitation is being pushed as a design feature. I get that it was supposed to make the sweater seem unique and handmade, and that 'Imported' can mean 'Italy' just as much as 'Bangladesh'... but didn't work for me. I feel like I have to reevaluate how blithely I buy from big clothing companies, now. Am I overreacting? What d'you think? How do you grapple with these ethical clothing issues, anyway? 
I have hawked this website for years and never been able to pull the trigger on my shopping cart because it was hard to spend that much on a brand I didn't know and was what I considered fast fashion. Well, Black Friday rolled around, and they had great deals on their black clothes. I basically emptied my wardrobe recently and realized I need some better clothes, especially for going out (I'm tragically stuck in buying things that are really only suitable for daytime). I bought a cute crop top, a pair of moto leggings, and a pair of underwear. I used the size chart. I used my intuition. NOTHING fits, and the quality is such a let down. The crop top is so effing cute but is so tight around the arms I knew I couldn't just simply overlook it and keep it. (armpit bulge anyone). The leggings are highwater in fit (doesn't look that way on the model) and the waist is gigantic. Hrm....ok. The quality didn't excite me either for paying 34 dollars on sale for simple leggings. I went my classic true size (M) on the underwear and they pretty much chop my ass cheeks in half, not to mention that there are blatantly loose and bunched threads all over them! How could you knowingly ship products like this? Honestly, Forever 21 products come in better shape. I decided to return the pants, and exchange the top for a larger size, because the top is adorable and decent quality. Oh, what's this? "We do not accept exchanges at this time". Convenient. If you return items for a full refund, you must pay a $5.99 "processing fee". I should have read closer about their "easy shipping and returns" policy. I never got a confirmation email that my package shipped, either. It just showed up yesterday. Pardon the rant, but I just want to warn you that this holy grail of a brand is mildly overrated for being online-based!

On the coattails of /u/Schiaparelli's really interesting [thread on gender &amp; fashion on and [this thread I thought we might tackle sexuality for this week's Sunday morning discussion. I'd really like to go a different direction than [the shallow assumptions in the infamous "How many of you are gay" and I think discussing whether or not there's a "*gay look*" is superficial and stupid, but I think that still leaves a lot of room. Like Schia in the thread on gender, I think the best way to approach this discussion is to think about **social expectations**, where they come from, and how/why they've evolved over time. Here's a few things off the top of my head, just to get the ball rolling - * How damaging is the "fashionable gay man" stereotype (to men all along the Kinsey scale)? Since I'm xposting this to FFA, what about the corresponding stereotype for gay women? * If you're being honest with yourself, has the fear of being perceived as gay steered your clothing decisions? * Is any of this really about sexuality at all - or is it just an issue of strict gender roles? 
Dyed boot next to original Finished Product! New to reddit so please forgive my poor formatting :C I bought these babies from a thrift store in Columbus for $15. I've been looking for winter boots for a while, so I was really excited to see a cheap pair of suede booties! I wasn't a big fan of the color though, but I bought them anyways. After having them for a few days, I decided that the color just wasn't for me and decided to buy some black RIT dye. I'm surprised that they turned out well, but let me know what you guys think.

I'm looking for bracelet suggestions to send to my fiance. I want a white gold bangle bracelet to wear on our wedding day and beyond.

Is Tiffany sterling silver a higher quality or something? I always associate sterling silver with cheap jewelry. Any other suggestions for reasonably-priced-but-quality jewelry are appreciated. :) Thank you! 
I was out shopping and found this really lovely calf-length skirt with a single layer of tulle over it. I loved the inspiration album from this [simple questions so I snapped it up. I head to the cashiers and she greets me, asks if I found everything ok, etc. She's doing her cashiering business when she randomly asks me if they have Halloween costumes in the store. I think, why would I know better than she would about Hallo...ooohhh. "It's not...a costume," I say. She pauses. "...Oh. Sorry about that." We finish the transaction--rather awkwardly--and I head out with my skirt. This town might not be ready for casual tulle, but I am! What are your stories about funny clothing misunderstandings?

So I know everybody is probably getting pretty tired of all the wedding attendee posts, but I'm seriously at a loss here. The wedding I'm attending is for one of my fraternity sisters. Church wedding at 3:30, banquet hall reception at 6:30. I asked her what would be appropriate and she responded with "people will probably be wearing nice dresses". Holy fucking helpful Batman.

boots 1: boots 2: I currently have boot 1 in beige. I originally wanted to buy boot 2 in beige but it sold out before I got a chance to place the order. I also just ordered boot 2 in chocolate leather (which is really more of a grey-brown according to the reviews &amp; other pictures I've seen). I also love the burgundy color in boot 2, but it's also sold out. Now my dilemma is: are boot 1 in beige and boot 2 in chocolate leather too similar to keep both? And I still want the burgundy color in boot 2 so if it comes back in stock, should I exchange the chocolate for the burgundy and keep boot 1 in beige and then have boot 2 in burgundy? Or - since I'm now partial to the grey-brown "chocolate leather" color in boot 2, should I keep that one and exchange boot 1 for the "chianti suede" color. So I guess to sum this all up - which boot has a better burgundy and which boot has a better beige/brown? Thanks! :)

She has a fairly athletic figure, and I can't get enough of her in lingerie. The problem is that she is horribly frugal and doesn't ever get any new stuff because of the price. I would say we are very well off financially for being in our mid thirties, and I want to get her some fun things. I am really only aware of the big name brands but I figure you all might know if you other places to get her some saucy underthings. As a bashful male, online retailers are easy but I am not above going to a store to pick something out either. I know this could be a bit of a minefield picking out clothing for a woman but having done her other things like this before she is always receptive to the gesture.

Title. I put on my peep toe black pumps this morning, that I've owned for over a year and worn maybe once, and five minutes in my feet were screaming in pain and I could not feel my toes.

I just want to look professional in my heels without losing my toes. :( 
I'm going on a trip later this year and finally decided to get a long overdue weekend bag. Til now, I've either used a way too big bag or a hot pink duffel I got for free from Ulta. Yesterday on a whim I ordered bag in cognac from Sole Society, bc it really has fantastic reviews (except for the smell, which apparently goes away). Since then I discovered Veeshee bags, which appeal to me because they're a little bigger and more customizable. I'm also assuming they're more durable than a cheaper, fake leather bag, but I have no real basis for thinking that. Now, I'm considering ordering a Veeshee [Tuscany too, or returning the other bag and getting the Veeshee instead. Do y'all think it's any more durable, though? The outside and inside are linen, with leather details, straps, and bottom. I take maybe 4-5 weekend trips a year so would use this bag for that purpose mostly. I wouldn't take it to work or the gym or to any other place more regularly. So, I don't expect a bag like this to sustain daily use, but I also don't want to invest $200ish in something that will last a year or two at most. What do y'all think? I'm open to other suggestions and recommendations. I did read past posts on these kinds of bags, and one was especially helpful. I'm particularly interested in staying under $200. I don't want to invest in a very high quality bag right now or rely on a great thrift store find, though I'm open to doing either/both in the future and will for sure return to y'all's recommendations! Thank you so much!! 
Hi, I'm thinking about donating a lot of my junior clothing (I get that I look like a student everyday!) and getting a new wardrobe look (I'm 25/f). What kind of styles should I look for esp. if I'm a software developer and the stereotype is jeans and shirts? Usually, I end up wearing a shirt and a jeans because that's what most of the people at my office wear (unless they're older, so they wear business casual). My measurements are something like 34-27-37, so I have a small waist but bigger bottom. Usually, I like to wear Jbrand jeans, sweaters in the winter and dresses (I love dresses but I'm afraid I will be judged in my workplace for wearing them!). I'm about 5'4" and I have black hair. 
As my old jeans wear out, I'm having some problems. Almost exclusively I get my clothing from a thrift store nearby. 90% of my jeans are mens jeans from there. I looooove the material of men jeans- unstretchy, sturdy, long lasting, no polyester. Doesn't cling or make you sweat, but still looks slim/skinny if done right. It's difficult to find a good size and fit (mens slim is really wide, so I'm picky), but I've done it for years. However, this store is closing in less than a week. No other thrift stores in my area whatsoever. Why is this a problem? I don't have a car and would have to cut into my meager jeans-money savings to ride the overpriced bus just to get to the nearest thrift store, which has awful reviews (overpriced savers with not much in it, apparently). Now I face the challenge of buying new, pricier jeans in a store within biking distance of my house. I'm fairly poor, especially in terms of this sub, and am unable to buy jeans over 20 dollars. Hopefully this will change in the future. I can't buy jeans online. I have fit issues/very picky. I like my jeans to be high rise, but high rise on me is 11+ inches. Now, with mens jeans that are normal rise, they usually hit my belly button anyway. Womens jeans do not do this, even if they are labelled "high rise". They hit 2 inches below my belly button. The cheap, clinging polyester-type fabric in many womens jeans also makes me sweat a lot for some reason. I do like vintage womens jeans in terms of material and rise, but they are hideously overpriced (30 at minimum for old jeans??), can't be tried on (online), and are often in odd styles (billowing thighs and tight ankles??). So I'm looking for advice on jeans. Can be male or female. There is Kohls, Target, Macys, JCP, H&amp;M, Forever 21, and a few other stores within reasonable distance of my house. Or maybe someone knows an online store that has very, very reliable size guides?

## So what's this French Wardrobe business? The French wardrobe philosophy to building and curating your wardrobe revolves around having a core of solid basics and expanding your wardrobe by buying **no more than five pieces a season** (a season defined as fall/winter and spring/summer—two per year). The idea behind it is to help you grow your wardrobe and transform your style in a sensible, sustainable way, with an eye towards longevity in quality and aesthetic. It asks you to **curate your wardrobe—expand with thought and care and towards your stylistic goals, and shop in a strategic fashion**. It's a great philosophy to consider both if you're just starting to build a "fashionable" wardrobe or if you're well into developing your personal style. If you're new to the idea, read the [first thread on the for an introduction (start at the heading: "Why should you follow this?"). We had some *excellent* thoughts in the comments—see the end of this post for the greatest hits from last time! Now that it's 2013 and we're moving into S/S, it seems like a pretty good time to revisit this idea, reopen discussion for the new members of our sub, and chat about: * *Temporally relevant*: * your resolutions for 2013 and how they might tie into this philosophy * your plans for the five spring/summer pieces you might buy (share ideas for good basics and pieces!) * *Always relevant*: * how to begin building a wardrobe and curate its direction * making a buying strategy for our wardrobe (stylistically? cohesively? financially?) * how to judge quality and utility of an item you want to buy * figuring out what items are worth investing in as one of our five allotted pieces * share anecdotes about things we bought, didn't buy, and so on from a more thoughtful bent than "Hey, I spent money on this thing" * talking about the French Wardrobe philosophy as it relates to consumerism, frugality, fast fashion, slow fashion, personal sartorial development Ladies. (Gentlemen, too.) What are your grand plans and specific plans for your wardrobe? Any questions or tips to share? *** ## The French Wardrobe rules Paraphrased from *(the wording varies from source to source, but the idea is the same)*. &gt; 1. Fabric and quality is more important than quantity. &gt; 2. Staple pieces (e.g. a white tee), socks, and underwear don't count. &gt; 3. Accessories don’t count, except if they cost a lot more than usual. &gt; 4. Shoes count. &gt; 5. Everything else counts. Fashion typically has two seasons: fall/winter and spring/summer, and that's what I encourage you to adhere to. The tricky bit about this, of course, is defining what's a "staple" and what's not. Staple items are usually quite personal depending on one's style and needs. ## Frequently expressed concerns * **Just because it's called the French Wardrobe philosophy doesn't mean you have to emulate the "French style"**. At its core, this is about *how* to buy things, not *what* to buy. Ignore all those lists that require you to have the perfect trench if that's not your thing. * **You don't have to have a huge clothing budget to be able to spend money on quality pieces**. In fact, I'd argue the smaller your budget, the more crucial it is to make quality and carefully considered buying paramount. MFA had a great thread recently on [how to afford to dress and many commenters expressed French Wardrobe-esque ideas: buy less, buy slowly, do less with more. *(And, of course: thrifting and eBaying and obsessive sales stalking.)* * **This isn't anti-trend, but anti-trendyitemsthatyou'llregretlater**. Buy in on trends if you love them, because the selection is great when things in vogue. Just make sure you aren't buying fast-fashion ripoffs that are cashing in on the *look* only and not the *construction*. *** ## Greatest hits from the last time around /u/zeoliet on her [purchasing strategy to find the most useful pieces for you and buying without &gt; The most important part is that the process takes weeks or more for me, that's why I call it a strategy and not just "shopping". &gt; &gt; 1. **Item Inspiration**. I've decided I want something. Perhaps it's from a blog or I just realized I had a hole. This item goes in my shopping list. My shopping list is with me at all times…*This list is specific!* For example I would write "navy crewneck sweater" rather than just sweater. Items have to be valid to my wardrobe before they even go on the list (fill a gap or be a replacement). &gt; 2. **Wait and Consider**. Every time I am getting dressed and think "I really wish I had…", I make a mental note of it. If I see a person in an item I know is on my list, I make a note of it. &gt; 3. **Evaluate the list**. Typically when I'm adding a new item, I look at the rest of my list. While I usually have a pretty good idea of what's on my list, sometimes I forget things. It's a good chance to cross off things I'm really not hyped about anymore. Perhaps I added a new item to the list and it negates an old item. Clean the list up. My list stays under 15 items including accessories. &gt; 4. **Window Shop**…Being extremely harsh in the dressing room is IMPORTANT to me. It must fit, be a good material, and be interesting in some way. Window shopping also includes surfing the internet as well as trying things on. Sometimes I try it on and love it, but I leave it there so that I can think about it. Sometimes the item is forgettable, and I move on. I also try on items outside of what I think my size should be, if I'm unsure of the brand's sizing (one size up or down)… &gt; 5.	**Make the deal**. Weeks or months later…I've finally found the perfect version of the item. Perhaps I tried it on previously and can't get it out of my head. I am completely committed to this item now. I usually wear it the next day, because I've already thought about how I want to wear it and all the many ways I could make it work. 	 /u/julzzrocks on [translating styles you like to a list of pieces you &gt; The first step, I think, is to make a list of the pieces you'll need the most to achieve a certain aesthetic. For instance, if you're looking at inspiration pictures, you can identify a common element…Take that one item, and find the one that's perfect for you…Don't go for the first one, or even the second, and give yourself an ample budget by cutting back on other clothing purchases. &gt; &gt; Basically, I would say isolate the pieces that would MOST bring the look together, then focus on peripheral ones. For instance, you can create a kind of aesthetic if you were to buy basic pieces you love, and which fit the aesthetic, and just a couple of must-have pieces that tie it together. /u/maneating_cats on [defining her style for a cohesive, easy-to-shop-for &gt; What helped me define my style was to pick a person whose style I loved, pick apart what I liked about their style, and distill it into a formula…I made a sort of uniform for myself from that. I know it sounds very rigid and formulaic and derivative, but it's worked wonderfully. I now have a small, cohesive wardrobe of classics I love and wear constantly…It's also made shopping less stressful—I don't feel pressured to try and consider everything and anything that looks good…sounds boring but it's helped calm down my materialistic urges. And I'm at the point where I don't feel like I really need or want more clothes, so it's worked. /u/cass314's [list strategy on figuring out what items to &gt; I have a small list, and every time I'm getting dressed…if I put together half an outfit and realize it doesn't work, but would work with "x", I write x down. &gt; &gt; Eventually, the things that I really ought to consider adding become very clear because I've written them down a dozen times. The other caveat is that unless it's on "the list", I can't buy it when I'm out and about. /u/DJGlowTryk on [the difference between interesting pieces and the pieces that are right for &gt; I think it is important to acknowledge the difference between something that you like, and something that is a good fit for your aesthetic… &gt; &gt; When I started, it was really hard for me because I bought a ton of stuff that I liked, but had a hard time working in with the pieces I already had. Gradually I was able to figure out a more coherent vision of how I wanted to look, and I could appreciate the items that were beautiful but not for me…Seeing something on yourself is a really important step. Find stores that have a good return policy so that you can take things home and see how they look with what you already own. An amazing top that you have to buy pants and shoes for is maybe not such an amazing top.

Almost a year ago, /u/lady_syrupp kicked off [this great about age and fashion. I thought it might be a fun topic to return to. Sometimes FFA posters ask whether something is age appropriate, or "how should a 22 year old dress" etc. I'm quick to say age shouldn't be the biggest factor driving your style but I thought it might be a fun discussion. -Are there things you used to wear you wouldn't wear now because of your age? -Are there things you might wear one day you feel are too 'mature' for you now? -Do you think age affects the appropriateness of a garment? -How have your tastes changed as you have gotten older?

/u/thethirdsilence posted a discussion on [Age &amp; Fashion which talked about age-appropriate clothes. The discussion reminded me of this book I just finished reading, called The Lost Art of Dress. One of the claims of the book is that women (specifically American women) have lost the art of dressing appropriately for their age and for the situation and instead, are dressing down too much. If you're interested, there's an article and a video about the book at CBS news called [Dressing down a culture for refusing to dress So I would like to know what everyone thinks. Do you think that everyday fashion nowadays is too casual? Should we be dressing up every time we leave the house? Should there be a difference between home clothes and outside clothes?

[This reminded me that I've been meaning to start a discussion on wardrobe overhauls. Discussion questions: 1. Have you ever done an intentional complete overhaul/revision of your wardrobe? 2. What sparked the overhaul? Changes in your style? Changes in trends? Changes in your body? Changes in your lifestyle? etc 3. How long did you spend on the overhaul? Did it take place over a few weeks, six months, a year? 4. How much planning did you do? 5. How did you feel afterwards? Did you feel ''done" with your wardrobe? 
Was suggested to x-post this here. If /r/femalefashionadvice is at all interested in an inspiration album of this sort with an emphasis on females and not males, I would enjoy putting one together - so don't hesitate expressing interest! 
**Super Basic** To ascertain a basic understanding of your body type: Measure your bust at the fullest part Measure your hips at the fullest part (often the groin or upper thighs) Measure your waist at the narrowest point I will use a hypothetical woman with 38 inch hips to discuss how your results may affects your body shape. **Women who do not have a very defined waist, ie, neither hip nor bust measurement is more than 8 inches greater than the waist measurement, are rulers. This can also be called the banana.** An example might be a woman who has 38 inch hips, a 32 inch waist, and a 37 inch bust. Her hips are nearly the same size as her bust, but her waist is not very defined. If a ruler feels she has a belly she wants to hide, she may prefer to follow guidelines for an apple. **If your waist measurement is bigger than your hips or your bust measurements, you are an apple**. An example would be a woman with a 35 inch bust, 39 inch waist, and 38 inch hips. **If your hips are your widest measurement by more than two inches, you are a pear.** An example would be a woman with a 35 inch bust, 25 inch waist, and 38 inch hips. **If your bust is your largest measurement by more than two inches, you are an inverted triangle or strawberry.** An example would be a woman with a 41 inch bust, 32 inch waist, and 38 inch hips. **If your bust and your hips are roughly the same size (within two inches), and your waist is at least 8-10 inches smaller you are an hourglass.** An example is a woman with a 37 inch bust, 27 inch waist, and 38 inch hips. ***That advice is wrong and doesn't work for my body type*** Body type advice is very, very limited (I will discuss this more in the final section) but can be useful for three reasons: 1) Many women do not have a sense of what their bodies actually look like and are hung up on a particular part or measurement. Having a sense of your silhouette can make a big difference-- you may feel like you have a belly but if your waist is tiny relative to your hips, you may look better thinking about how to play up your proportions rather than hide your belly. 2)It can help you understand why garments fit you the way they do, and why you have a particular set of fit challenges. 3) Many women who are frustrated with their body would like to look more like an elongated hourglass. Understanding how your body overlaps or differs from this type can help you improve the way you dress. However, it is important to note that this is not every woman's goal but is a potential starting point. **Ok cool, what do I do now?** 1) Search FFA and Google for recommendations for your body type. You will find a wealth of knowledge and past posts for [reverse and Actually, re-looking at this, we haven't talked as much about rulers on FFA. 2) When reading this advice, think about whether you like it. Most advice is trying to help women create a more hourglass shape (ie pears should add volume up top, etc). These might not be your figure priorities. 3) When looking for clothes, understand that most mall manufacturers are cutting their garments for a woman who has a slight pear shape (bust 7-8 inches larger than waist, hips about 10 inches larger than waist). This is the most common body type and manufacturers are interested in fitting as many women as possible into a given size. Many women post to FFA looking for the perfect brand that caters to their body type. Some brands may run curvier or straighter, but in general, there are very, very few brands that set out to cater to, say, the apple shaped woman. In general, you are going to have to buy clothing to fit the largest part of your body, and be prepared to either get things tailored, or buy things where a looser fit does not matter. However, it is worth paying attention to cuts that work for you. I'm an hourglass with a proportionately broader upper body and will always have better luck with Vero Moda (Danish company) than Uniqlo (Japanese company). A petite Asian woman is likely to have the opposite experience. 4) If you are unsatisfied with this analysis and would like to go a bit deeper into dressing your body, please keep reading. **More Advanced** The first thing I would like to reinforce is that the idea of body type is very limited and just a jumping off point for understanding your silhouette. This idea has multiple components: 1) The most important thing is what aspects of your body you would personally like to play up and play down. Please read /u/Schiaparelli's excellent [guide in the side for a really incredible take on proportion. Most body type advice is about looking skinnier or looking more like an hourglass. This might not be what you want. It's good to have a mental list in your head about what components you would like to play up or down. I have wide shoulders and like them to look bigger, not smaller. This may be different for your than for your friends or your shopping buddies, so have in mind how you would like to look. Hips are a real flash point for a lot of women so some women may say anything that emphasizes the hips looks bad. How you feel about this depends on your own personal proportions. That said, try to focus more on your overall silhouette than "the area over my knee looks chunky and I hate it." More people will see the forest, not the trees. There should be some balance between "I'm an hourglass so I follow hourglass rules that work for all hourglasses" and "It's really important for me to hide my bony elbows, wide ribcage, and love handles, while making my calves look more proportionate. What style of dress will do that?" 2) There are many other body type systems and guides, many of which take more measurements into account and are more thorough. A personal favorite is Imogen Lamport's system, which you can read about If you are into this stuff, you can google around for a system that works best for you-- the one above is just the most common and straight forward as a starting point. 3) A lot of us don't find our body shape that important or helpful when dressing. You can read more about that in [this On the other hand, many of us have found understanding our measurements helpful in order to [appreciate our bodies 4) Other measurements and proportions that may be helpful in understanding your body (this is just a preliminary look): -Height: if you are very tall, you may look more like a ruler despite having hourglass proportions, for instance. If you are very short, you will look a lot curvier than someone ten inches taller than you given the same measurements. (Sir Mixalot demonstrates an excellent understanding of this concept when stating his preference for curvier women: "36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3".) -Leg length to torso length -[short versus long waisted: this intersects with torso length but is a bit different. -Hip shelf versus slope: do your hips start right under your waist or do you have a sloping curve out to your hips? -Shoulder width: if you are a pear with broad shoulders, you may feel/look more like an hourglass. If you are an hourglass with broad shoulders, you may look more like an inverted triangle. -Underbust: how narrow is your torso, aside from your waist? Do you have a broad ribcage? -butt versus hips: does your hip measurement come more from butt volume or from hip width? If you have a round/athletic butt, your hip measurement may be large but look relatively narrow from the front. -weight: skinnier women may appear to be rulers whereas heavier women may appear to be apples. Skinny women may also assume they are rulers because they don't see themselves as "curvy" whereas heavier women may think midsection weight makes them an apple. -Generally, side/side measurements versus back/front measurements. The way we tell people to measure their proportions is with a tape measure, getting a 360 degree measurement. An alternate way of assessing body shape is tracing your shape in a mirror or on graph paper. This results in a side-side, front view body type rather than a 360 degree one. Either approach is ultimately limited. If you have a straight up and down torso with a large bust and a round butt, you may not feel like an hourglass or look like one in the mirror (torso does not slope out or in for waist) but you will measure like one. If you have a broad ribcage and hips with a defined waist (common among large framed people who are at their lowest weight) but a flat chest and butt, you could have a very sloped, curvy torso from the front but measure like a ruler. The better you understand some of these alternate variables, the better you may understand how your body looks. It can also help in understanding why clothing does or doesn't fit you. I have a small waist but a proportionately large ribcage and was frustrated with poor dress fit throughout my teens until I finally understood it was my underbust and not my waist that caused this issue. While this doesn't necessarily help me find magic dresses for large ribcaged women, it helps me feel less frustrated with my body. Measurements can be a source of anxiety but they are also a source of power. In our body image conscious society, many women have frustrations with their body shaped on their experiences. If you went through puberty early, you may always feel like your curves are extreme because they developed early. Looking at your actual measurements may serve as a counterpoint to these sentiments. I often see two women post on FFA with very similar measurements, and one feels she has the perfect body she wants to flaunt whereas another feels like everything is wrong. One's own feelings about one's body are a really important factor when getting dressed, but understanding your measurements and how they shape garment fit can be a helpful reality check. I hope people find this a useful starting point in thinking about body shape. I think it can be one useful analytic tool in thinking about how to dress oneself but should never be seen as more than a tool in your arsenal. You may choose to reject it entirely, or determine that a different factor is most important to you when selecting your silhouette.

The album: I've had a hard time pinning down what my style really is. When I was fourteen I went through my "emo" phase, all black and white stripes and terrible eyeliner. High school was a lot of graphic tees and jeans and hoodies until my grad year, when I went a little preppy. I bought a couple button ups from Tommy Hilfiger, swapped half my hoodies for cardigans, and called myself sophisticated. I started frequenting FFA around then. During my first year at uni I became interested in the french/capsule wardrobes, and fell in love with the idea that you can pull a random top and a random bottom from your closet and nine times out of ten you would have a cohesive outfit. Fortunately for me, this was eased by my love of neutrals and muted colours, allowing easier mixing and matching. I pared down my wardrobe considerably, keeping a lot of black and discarding much of my brighter clothing. The inspo and discussion here really helped me round out my style, which is a little bit of each of minimal, french, and dark/goth, with a pinch of ninja. The dream - equal parts effortless Parisian twenty-something and Disney super-villain, haha. That led me straight to the all-black look. I changed my [tumblr fashion over from a mish-mash of fashion images to a celebration of the all-black aesthetic. While my true style doesn't involve all-black outfits all the time, I try to do it once or twice a week, and it's fun to challenge myself that way. It's rare that I feel as sexy or as powerful as I do in black ponte pants, my Everlane black U-neck, and my black-on-black converse. I love the and [goth ninja by inspo albums, but neither quite fit the bill for what I was looking for, so I worked on this on and off for a few months. I hope you all enjoy it, and maybe feel inspired - you all have helped me very much that way. :)

I want to end the challenge on July 19th.** I'll post reminders more heavily for the next week, and then cool down to Friday update/reminder posts in the FFA and MFA General Discussion threads. --- Hey, FFA. We've had discussions in the past about [personal and that to help you analyze your wardrobe, but thus far we've seen no community examples. I propose a challenge to change that. For the next month, participants should take a picture of their outfit every day, and compile them into an album for a discussion at the end of the month. My hope is that we'll be able to talk about how uniform or not our styles really are and have a peek into the outfits of FFA'ers outside of WAYWT days. It's a really simple challenge, and I don't want to impose any constraints - just dress like you normally would, but take a picture on your way out the door! --- If you're interested in participating, please leave a post so we can get a rough headcount going! Don't be afraid to talk about your predictions for your own outfits, what you hope to see at the end of the month, or anything else related to the challenge. Also please feel free to post any inspiration, such as blog posts about 30 day challenges (or similar) and other examples of completed daily outfit challenges. We've gotten some great suggestions and questions so far, so a few things to consider as you approach this challenge: * you could use this to help pare down your wardrobe! * this could serve as motivation to get dressed or care about your presentation on off days! * consider writing a sentence or two about the occasions for each outfit! * PJs are totally great, submit pics of your lazy days too! I strongly suggest including at least 14 outfits in your final albums, so we can get a good sense of your daily style. --- I have a few logistical concerns that I'd like to get all of your opinions on in this thread. * How often would you like to see reminders? I would post something in recurring threads like GD not a standalone thread. * What are your feelings about latecomers to the challenge? I want to be as inclusive as possible, but I also think that posting one outfit at the end ignores the spirit of the challenge. How many outfits would you want to see? Any feelings about crossposting to WAYWT? (i.e. what if someone submits an album containing pictures that have all been in the past month's WAYWT?) * Any other concerns/ideas, bearing in mind that the goal is to get a snapshot of what FFA'ers normally wear. --- Please upvote this thread for visibility! It's a self-post, so no karma for me, I just want people to know about it~

Slightly piggybacking off the ["what is going out of style" what are some things you wish never went out of style? Do you have any trends you love? I love [olive green utility They seem to be lasting. I live across the water from NYC and last year EVERYONE seemed to have some kind of olive green coat on. It was great. I LOVED it when it was suddenly everything. Are chambray shirts and denim shirts considered a trend? Because I own a ton. Also, I freaking love the look of origami hem skirts. Crop tops are an idea I'm warming up to since I have so many high waisted skirts. Having to tuck in only an inch of fabric seems like it would be nice. I want to buy a couple different basic ones. I really love dark tartan/plaid print. I own one piece, a thrifted AE blue/green bomber jacket (sounds crazy I know). Finally, I don't know if this is a trend, but I absolutely love the look of women in brightly colored sneakers/classy outfits. In NYC you'll see girls in these structured, beautiful, all black outfits with a pair of bright flyknits and for some reason, I LOVE IT. 
**[New Balance Classics Sneakers are making their ways into the world of fashion as people enjoy their comfort and looks. While some styles (such as the sleeker silhouettes of the Nike Frees and Flyknits) have been somewhat easily accepted, New Balance Classics seem to be having a harder transition. New Balance shoes are heralded as being some of the most comfortable and supportive shoes around. The Classics are not stereotypical running shoes, they are fashion sneakers, and can be incorporated into many casual looks and styles outside of the gym. It's possible to enjoy the comforts of sneakers and look good at the same time.

It seems as if it's been quite some time since there's been a discussion about women and raw denim. I was simply wondering what your thoughts and feelings are towards raw denim. Do any of you have a pair, or have you tried any on? FWIW, I'm a male and I actually recently realized just how hard it is to find a proper fitting pair when searching for a pair to buy for my girlfriend. I'm also a pretty frequent user over on /r/rawdenim. We're starting to have more consistent female contributors which is great since the interest shouldn't be limited to just a male audience. So, without further ado, /r/femalefashionadvice, how do you feel about women and raws?

[Last week we announced the Post your fits below! 
I see a lot of fairly conservative fits here and only occasionally something that looks unusual. I have nothing against that type of style but it's not the only way to look cute and stylish. Is there anyone else here who actually likes kitschy clothing items sometimes and looking a little funky? Edit: I'm not here to try to insult anyone! I love a lot of what I see on here! Please don't take my question as a personal attack on your sense of style. Edit 2: The reason why I posted this is because I find a lot of fashion advice and *sometimes* but not always, this forum to be a little exclusionary. I was motivated especially by [this] thread. I notice that it's a year old but I really can't stand this attitude of rules about fashion.

As a guy I think it would be great to get the opposite sex's input AS WELL AS the guys' Here's what I said to the guys &gt; Now before you downvote me to oblivion hear me out. I believe that it would be awesome to have a kind of swap where once every week or 2 weeks or something we post a WAYWT to /r/femalefashionadvice and they post one to our subreddit so that we can get feedback from each other and a different point of view. (Not that you guys aren't awesome and helpful, it would just be... different) So if this gets good feedback I'll find a way to make it happen. Thanks!

Welcome to /r/femalefashionadvice! Please read our policies below before posting, or check out our for a more complete set of FAQs, community expectations, and more. **Before you post** ##Is your post spam? For the purposes of this subreddit, spam is anything that we deem to be made purely with the intent to generate traffic to another website or abuse FFA’s structure to promote a website or a blog. Our spam policy is zero-tolerance - spammers will be banned immediately. If you believe you have been banned wrongly, please feel free to [message the - note, however, that this does not guarantee or even imply a reversal of a ban. The following things are considered spam or suggest to us that a user may be spamming FFA. Please report any of the following: * Affiliate links (a link that is tied back to you such that you will profit from users clicking that link or buying something from it) * Users without histories of legitimate comments (on Reddit in general or in FFA) beginning to push one website or company * Users with usernames that consist of/include a website or company name (use your best judgment here) If there is a website, service, product, blog, etc., you are legitimately excited about and want to share with FFA, please feel free to do so. However, if you are employed by the company or it is your own blog, message the moderators for approval prior to doing so and review our [brand participation This is to ensure that FFA is not exploited for website traffic or monetary gain, and that the subreddit is not overrun with unrelated spam. This is one of many reasons we are self-post only - you may find further clarification of that policy ##Is your post in the right place? There are many subreddits related to clothing and personal appearance. Here is an incomplete list, along with their purposes: * /r/findfashion - If your question is, "please help me find this article of clothing (in my size, for cheaper, in my country)" or similar, please use this subreddit. Alternatively, check out our recurring Find Fashion thread posted Fridays. * /r/frugalfemalefashion - Posts about sales, coupons, or other deals belong here. * /r/wardrobepurge - Trying to sell or buy clothing? Check out Wardrobe Purge! * /r/makeupaddiction, /r/fancyfollicles, /r/skincareaddiction - for makeup, hair, and skincare advice, respectively. Alternatively, check out our recurring Hair, Makeup, Skincare, Fitness and Fragrance thread posted Tuesdays. ##Is your post better suited to one of our recurring threads? FFA has a series of weekly recurring threads that consolidate some of our most common concerns. Our most up-to-date schedule of threads can be found in the sidebar. **Daily**: * [Simple a thread for basic questions, such as "How often should I dry-clean my blazers?" or "What are your favorite black heels &amp;lt;$100?" **Monday:** * [Recent a thread to show off any recent purchases as well as provide a small review for the community **Tuesday:** * [Hair, Makeup, Skincare, Fitness and a thread dedicated to questions and comments regarding hair, skin, makeup, fragrance, cosmetology, nail polish, fitness, and other related topics; * [Theme WAYWT (see Thursday as well): every week we offer a fun thread dedicated to dressing according to a theme, which is announced on Thursdays.

If something is truly time-sensitive, exceptions may be made. ## Is your post just a search away? Before you make a post, use Reddit's search feature. Try different keywords related to your query and read through those. You'd be surprised at what's come up before! You can also use Google. If you're looking to identify a specific article of clothing, try Google reverse image search or using keywords related to the brand, color, fabric, pattern, etc., of the article in question (if that fails, try posting your question in one of the daily Simple Questions thread or Find Fashion on Friday). If you're looking for a general article (i.e., a black leather jacket instead of a specific black leather jacket), try using a style aggregator. Sites like and allow you to input search terms (from the very general to the very specific) and sort within a price range to help you find what you're looking for. If it's shoes you're after, try - they have an impressive range of search attributes to help you find shoes, even for the difficult-to-fit customer (wide or narrow calfs, short or long legs, wide or narrow feet). Make sure you've taken advantage of all of these resources before making a separate post asking for help finding an item. ## Have you checked out the sidebar? FFA's sidebar contains some of our most valuable bits of wisdom - on everything from [body [selling your garments [how to dress for a and [how to find a bra that (also check out /r/ABraThatFits for advice on how a bra *should* fit).

For me I can't wear animal prints, like cheetah, at all. I see ladies wearing them and they look great, but for whatever reason I just can't do it. I have the same issue with dresses with a lot sparkle and glam, for no logical reason I just don't like wearing them. I fall into this really bad habit of wearing just plain LBDs to every party I go to. It's not even like I'm against standing out and wearing noticeable clothing, I adore Lilly and Vera Bradley. But every time I get to the dressing with a cheetah top or a leopard skirt, no matter how cute it is, I can't bring myself to buy it. So ladies what things will you just not wear, for inexplicable reasons? 
Personally for me this is hard to imagine, because, 1) I like the stuff I wear, so I can't imagine not liking it later, and 2) I feel like a lot of stuff that is popular today is very toned-down compared to, say, the 2000's. For example, I loved butterfly hair clips and gaucho pants back in the day, but would *never* wear them today. What trends of *today* do you think we will look back on and wonder why it was ever popular? 
Post all your wedding related questions here whether you're a guest, part of the bridal party, or the bride! 
Recently I saw some shoes that I really liked: leather, right height, black, good brand. When I looked at the other pictures, I noticed they had gold soles. Nope, I don't do gold-colored stuff. I just don't like it. Then I got to thinking, anytime I see gold in any way, I immediately cross off the item. What other crazy rules have I set for myself? I also hate dresses with a seam across the waist. They look silly on me. I don't know why, but they do. I don't mind them on other people, but when I try them on, I immediately feel about 5 years old again. Sometimes I love everything about a dress, and then I zoom in to see a hidden waist seam. Or I see it across the store only to find out it has that stupid seam. Nope, no longer interested. What are your self-made fashion rules that you never cross?

I love her style and this breakdown of it is great. Now we just need inspiration from her on super hot, sticky, sweaty wardrobe choices. 
I see stuff all the time where I literally think, "You would have to pay me to wear that" just to peek at the price and see it costs more than I have in my savings. Post pics or give a text description, make sure to include the price! This should be fun! 
Let's talk about brands and stores. Each top level comment will list a brand or store in **bold**; please reply to the comment with useful information including typical price ranges, sizing information, types of clothing sold, etc. Also helpful would be sales cycles for stores, or w/r/t to brands where they could be found for less.

FFAs all over the world - what would be considered a fashion blunder in your part of the world? For example, what is the local consensus on [riding "yay or nay?")? 
On your road to curating and maintaining a personal style, what has been one of your best epiphanies? Long term or short term, big or small! Just what has been an interesting observation about you and your clothes? 
I think Black Milk is super tacky. And 90% of the girls who wear Modcloth don't really fit the twee style, it just looks like a pastel ice cream van collided with a group of try-hard hipsters. 
You know what you need, you've identified your style and what works for you, you have a set budget, and then you're done for a while. No more payday splurges, no drunk online shopping, no buying because you're bored, because then you end up with stuff you don't want or need and it's stupid. ...And then you see it. That thing you just have to buy because you need it, because it's a staple, because it's good value, because you might one day be required to wear something like that at some other job, or whatever other lies you tell yourself. So, what's that item? For me: * [Bags that come with They come with another bag! How useful is that? It's not like I already own plenty of little bags that I can put inside a big bag. No. * Jersey knit black dresses. I don't have one that's just above the knee *and* has short sleeves. This is a huge hole in my wardrobe. Obviously. * Leggings. I need the thicker ones, thinner ones, slightly longer ones, slightly shorter ones, the thick waistband ones, the thin waistband ones. I don't really wear leggings very much. But I might. I *might.* ETA: ha, we're all a bunch of suckers. 
WAYWT is the acronym for "What Are You Wearing Today". It doesn't necessarily need to be what you were wearing TODAY. * Post as often as you like, but edit your first post with pictures * Include what the attire is for (work, school, home) * Pictures are incredibly encouraged as it's quite tough to imagine what someone else is wearing without them. * Critiquing others is welcome and encouraged, but keep it constructive/factual. Take a lesson from Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People if needed. It takes balls to post pictures of yourself on the Internet, the least you can do is accord the same courtesy as you would to someone in real life. * Please do not downvote for not agreeing with someone's opinion. * Reddit Enhancement Suite makes it very easy to view pictures in a thread. --- **PLEASE SORT BY "NEW" SO EVERYONE GETS A CHANCE TO BE SEEN! THANK YOU!** 
I always see women who wear heels out and about and envy them- I've never been able to figure out how to wear them without my feet hurting (mostly in the ball of my foot) terribly after a few hours, and because of it, looking like a giraffe on stilts.... I have flat-ish feet, if that matters. I can't figure out if it's the shoes, or my feet, or how I walk, or what. I want to be able to wear them more, because I see so many that I would LOVE for going but I feel like they'll just collect dust because they hurt me. So.... how?! Edit: wanted to say thank you to everyone who's replied! Keep em coming :) I'm reading everything and reading everyone's input is fascinating. You've inspired me to go shoe shopping at some point this week ;) 
had a great on These posts are so funny--I was inspired to bring the conversation here. Following u/Scylla_and_Charybdis' lead, here are the guidelines to play along. Post only the name of a brand/store as a top level thread and then respond to that comment. Let's remember to keep the conversation light-hearted. 
The video can be found I'm interested to know what you guys think about this. What are some steps we as consumers can take to make to make sure that we aren't encouraging this? 
I've been pondering this [NYT this morning and would love to hear others' opinions on it. I find it frustratingly prescriptive/narrow-minded that the writer attributes the trends/aesthetic being covered in this article—socks, turtlenecks, denim jackets, long skirts, flatforms—as the result of women "choosing not to dress for a man's gaze." &gt;Many young women today choose not to dress for a man’s gaze, even when the weather seems to dictate the baring of skin. The reason are varied: the appeal of thrifting, a ’90s comeback, the end of workplace dress codes, the rising tide of fourth-wave feminism, a newfound combativeness toward street harassment, the current fluidity of gender — or some combination. Is seems *particularly* backwards to attribute "the current fluidity of gender" to women choosing not to dress for a man's gaze. I think the writer missed the obvious thing, which is that this style is popular among a subset of people and that it has less to do with not wanting to dress for men and everything to do with fashion/antifashion/the dregs of normcore/anti-fit. The male gaze should not have even been a part of this article. There's no need to make this style into a holier-than-thou feminist thing because in the end it's all fashion, and there will be women with this aesthetic dressing for men just as there are women with "traditional" "flattering" "hourglass" aesthetics dressing for themselves. These women look good to themselves and to the people who are interested in this aesthetic, whether they're male or female (and I don't even want to talk about the weird heteronormative viewpoint of this article). Am I losing it? Am I missing the point? Am I once again getting too po'd because every few months the Times covers some subsect of fashion as if the reporter has found a strange new Amazon tribe that no one has ever seen before? 
I have a pair of Croc flats that I wear constantly. [My boyfriend thinks they are hideous.]( He lovingly dubbed them "crogs". I don't think they are fashionable but they are sooooo comfortable to wear when walking around. What ugly or unfashionable things do you wear regularly? Pictures encouraged! 
Ladies, show me your favourite dresses with pockets! 
Post questions, inspo, and all Halloween related things hurrrrr Edit: Our special ed. Halloween WAYWT will be Nov 2 - please hold off on posting costumes until then! 
After being given the runaround in the most recent meta thread I have come to the conclusion that the best (and possibly only) way to discuss what us subscribers feel are the largest issues plaguing this subreddit is to have a frank discussion. I personally saved my responses to the confidential mod feedback survey posted I understand that it is likely nobody else saved their survey responses but I hope that by posting my response people will feel free to chime in. I do not expect everyone to agree with me, but I hope that by voicing my own opinions that people will feel that they can share their own. * **How comfortable do you currently feel contributing in IMAM? Are you ever nervous or uncomfortable to submit a post or a comment? Feel free to explain why!** I feel comfortable contributing to /r/indiemakeupandmore most of the time, but if I have something less than positive to say about a customer service experience or product I do feel uncomfortable. I feel when I have a negative experience I have to qualify it in such a way that it is my fault (e.g. eyeshadows don't work for me because I have poor application skills, I contacted the owner through the website's contact form which doesn't work and I should have used Facebook instead, etc.). I find it unfortunate that we, as a subreddit, are more concerned with owners' feelings and profits than our own money and safety. In my opinion, this is an atmosphere cultivated by the moderators. By not sharing negative reviews or experiences in stand-alone submissions or blog posts but only in comments, they have created a hush-hush atmosphere that works largely in favor of owners. I have seen various comments buried in posts from older moderators warning against brands (such as Star Crushed Minerals) whose swatches remain on IndieKnow, and on their flickr gallery which has been a fixture on the /r/indiemakeupandmore sidebar for as long as I can recall, unqualified. Whether intended or not these swatches and posts serve as endorsements of the brand by the subreddit (something I personally am uncomfortable with). A recent example of how moderators have created this atmosphere is the decision to sidebar /u/Ajevie's post, "[Editorial] Fan or Fanatic: How to be a great Brand Cheerleader without being an A**". Inherent in the title is the expectation that subscribers are "Brand Cheerleaders," and the decision to sidebar this post over the similarly popular and more neutral "The art of reviewing" post by /u/whereismydragon is in exceedingly poor taste. * **Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the subreddit? Any idea, big or little, is welcome here! If you have any ideas on how we can improve things in IMAM please share them with us.** First of all, I think it would greatly help if every moderator (both new and old) thoroughly read reddiquette. Here is a link: The reason I suggest reading reddiquette is because under the "Please don't" section there is "[Please don't] Take moderation positions in a community where your profession, employment, or biases could pose a direct conflict of interest to the neutral and user driven nature of reddit." Bloggers are a gray area but without question /u/benoit_balls should have been removed as a moderator when she decided she would be opening a store. As a moderator, with the ability to set rules that she as an owner would have to follow for advertising/posting in the community and to enforce them for her competitors would have been a direct conflict of interest. The fact that this was something up for community discussion, and that some of the current moderators supported her remaining on, is at odds with the nature of reddit and leads me to genuinely question their judgment. More significantly, there is an ongoing conflict of interest between the IndieKnow bloggers, /u/seashells_15 and /u/speakstruth, and their ability to moderate. Aside from featuring the flickr swatch gallery on the sidebar (directing new users to IndieKnow over the many other blogs that have excellent swatches that deserve to be featured as well), /u/seashells_15 and /u/speakstruth use /r/indiemakeupandmore to gauge the needs and interests of the indie community but respond as bloggers, not moderators. Instead of building a robust wiki and sidebar with resources for beginners, they have externalized material that would be well served on the sidebar to their blog. In particular, the "Indies 101" series with "A beginner's guide" "Should I Buy From This Company?" and "Help, my order is going wrong!" includes 2 posts submitted by moderator /u/seashells_15 (AG). The main resource IndieKnow blogger-moderators have created for the sidebar is the disorganized hodgepodge of posts flaired "Great for Beginners." (The other response to the flood of new users was the inconsequential Indie Angels program, the flaws of which will be detailed later.) While the blog, to the best of my knowledge, is not a significant source of income, the page views and attention these moderators have directed towards their site increase their blog's value to brand owners and the likelihood they are offered press samples. For example, I don't know of any blogger aside from /u/seashells_15 (or AG of IndieKnow) that currently receives press samples from Shiro Cosmetics. I suggest the IndieKnow blogger-moderators decide whether or not they are capable of being impartial moderators going forward, and if they are not up to the task to leave one of their positions. For the remaining moderators, I urge you to learn from your predecessors' mistakes. Instead of cultivating an atmosphere where subscribers are fearful to voice less than positive reviews or experiences, lead by example and share your own. Remove the IndieKnow and "Brand Cheerleader" bias from the sidebar, and expand it as a resource for both new subscribers and old. While the reactionary approach of longtime moderators of /r/indiemakeupandmore has been to half-heartedly cater to the newest subscribers (e.g. "Great for Beginners" tag and Indie Angels program), with proper resources available on the sidebar you can focus on retaining existing subscribers and encouraging quality content. The moderating team needs to start recognizing subscribers who consistently submit quality content. While the Indie Angels program was modeled after the Valued Advice Givers program of /r/femalefashionadvice, it missed the point as flair was given to any individual who asked rather than those with a proven track record of helpfulness. Further, there is nothing on the sidebar noting its existence. The result of this poorly executed program is that any user of /r/indiemakeupandmore who joined after the introductory Indie Angels post is left in the dark as to what the wings possibly mean, and has no idea there is any such program in place to help them. The Indie Angels program needs to be replaced with one that recognizes thoughtful contributions. * **Is there a single issue you feel should be urgently addressed? Are there any things you would like to see the mods addressing as soon as possible? Please let us know what they are and why!** Aside from the glaring conflict of interest /u/seashells_15 and /u/speakstruth pose to the moderating team, it would be nice if the Scent of the Day posts were expanded to include all products. It seems rather silly to exclude makeup or any other "and more" products. The schedule could also use some reworking, as there are occasionally 2 posts within 12 hours. * **Tell us more, speak your mind. Feel free to give us any other ideas or feedback here!** I sincerely hope the moderating team address my concerns, and those raised by other subscribers, in a post shortly. Edit: I want to be clear that the sidebar resources do not link to IndieKnow. I am really sorry if I gave anyone that impression in my post (it was intended for the moderators who would be more intimately acquainted with the sidebar). The sidebar, under "helpful links" includes a link to their Flickr swatch gallery, and says this "Indie Know's Indie Swatch Gallery (Disclosure: contributed to by both /u/seashells15 and /u/speakstruth). My qualm with its presence (which IMO is clearly controversial given the necessity for a disclosure) is that it informs users of IndieKnow as a blog over all others, and indirectly directs them to IndieKnow. The Indie 101 series, which I mentioned in my post/survey response, is not linked on the sidebar. However, I have made multiple suggestions to the moderators for a more robust sidebar, and I was disappointed to see content submitted to the blog instead of the subreddit. 
As Lilly Pulitzer has been a topic of discussion this week I thought it would be interesting to hear FFA's thoughts/reactions/opinions on this piece. 
Right now I'm obsessed with the 70s resurgence movement that is happening. I am also obsessed with Euro-chic style and minimalism. My solution? A hodgepodge of all of those styles. Sorry if some images aren't seasonally appropriate/don't fit the intended aesthetic. I will be looking to this album for my Summer style inspiration and I hope you do too. [Enjoy!] :) 
So by now Pink Sunday is over - actually, let's be real: it was over online *before* the official launch and over in-stores within minutes of opening. Right now scalpers on ebay are posting the collection for double and triple the retail prices. *Please* do not turn to ebay for this collection, not because there is inherently anything wrong with buying used/new clothes from ebay (at all!), but because you shouldn't reward those inconsiderate people. More importantly, check back in at your local Target stores within the next two weeks - there's a small window for returns, so many people will be returning items. Once they go back to the floor, you might find that item you wanted (and possibly at an additional discount). For those of us who don't want to wait for returns to start trickling in, I was thinking maybe we could get a swap/want thread going. Basically, if you *really* wanted something but couldn't get it, post here so someone can keep an eye out for you. Or, if you got a pattern/size you don't want or didn't fit, offer to swap it for something you did want. (I hope this is alright, mods!) I'll start: I've got a size 2 shift dress in the pattern Happy Place. I'm not a huge fan of the pattern in-person (colors looked different to me online). I really, really wanted the Nosie Posy shift dress, size 2, so if anyone wants to trade, please let me know! **EDIT**: This might help you swap out sizes with other redditors: [Lilly Pulitzer for Target Size Chart for Women's For comparison, [Lilly Pulitzer Size The main take-away from the comparison of the size charts is that, technically, the Target line is running either 1inch or .5 inch bigger in certain dimensions.

This thread is for simple hair and makeup questions that you may have, especially those that don't warrant their own thread. We all want a diversified opinion, so feel free to answer any questions (of which you know the answer). Example questions: * What's a good conditioner for straight, thick hair? * Where can I find a perfume with subtle pine notes? * Do you use a foundation with sunscreen? Is it worth it? 
I spent my entire teenage years trying to look scenester/punk and failing miserably, but always lived in envy of the girls who were able to seamlessly blend in.

My feet always blister, I sweat through all my clothes, my jeans never fit me quite right because they're tight as soon as they're out of the dryer but loose as shit after the end of a long day, I mean... Does anyone have any success stories of going from frumpy dumpty to effortless fashionista? I guess I'm just not realizing how much effort really goes into looking put together... Edit: you guys are so helpful :') 
For real this time. Post your albums! If you don't have a full month of pictures, don't worry about it (I also do not have a full month). Show us what you have. And please take some time to look at the other albums and share some thoughts on other users' months. These things are way more fun when everyone gets feedback. Feel free to include your own thoughts on your month in your OP. **Edit: It looks like there's some weird downvoting happening. Please don't downvote submissions!

Hi guys, I posted this in Simple Questions and realised it wasn't actually simple at all. I'm curious to see what everyone thinks so I'm posting a stand alone for more visibility and hopefully a great discussion. is my original comment, in case you want to see the answers that already spawned. I'll paste it again here: &gt;I've been working on my proportions lately, and making sure I balance out my long torso by wearing shorter tops and higher waisted bottoms. &gt;My question is, do proportions come in and out of fashion? Is the "fashionable proportion" right now to have a shorter torso and longer legs? I ask this because I feel like back in the 2000s, people were all about longer tops and lower waisted bottoms. Was the "fashionable proportion" back then to have a longer torso and shorter legs? I feel like that looked normal back then, and nobody thought they look unbalanced. &gt;I am confused about this because I also thought that the most "flattering" proportion for someone is always constant, since it balances out your top and bottom half. I have been trying to focus my shopping on shorter tops, but then I worried that a longer torso may come back in style and I will regret all my short tops/it will begin to look weird to me. Does that make sense? When I say "flattering", I do mean a balanced body in regards to torso length and leg length. I'm not talking boxy tops or looking curvier, etc. ETA: I mean torso to leg ratio! What do you all think? 
I'm at a crossroads right now debating whether or not to buy a Burberry London trench coat (I hear London is much better quality than Brit) but boyyyy the price difference! What was the most expensive item you have bought? edit: I'm going to read and reply to every one of you guys later today, but thanks so much for your imput! Definitely making me feel like something of quality will be worth it and that we are all on the same page, haha! 
Prom and formal questions go here. Need help deciding between two dresses? Unsure what shoes to wear with said dress? Not sure how to do your hair? Don't know what makeup is? Wondering where the hell this thread was a few weeks ago, because you already HAD your prom? It was actually all part of our devious plan, because now you can answer questions! HA HA! 
I have a lot of disjointed thoughts about this, but I'm going to make a list here of some of the things I want to say: - I often feel embarrassed to be interested in fashion and clothes in general, because I feel like it is materialistic and superficial. Even under the context of self-expression, only those with more money can afford greater freedom in this realm. I was having a conversation with my dad last night about school uniforms, and he told me that he grew up so poor in rural India that he literally could not afford any clothes to wear out, aside from the 3 sets of identical uniforms he wore to school as a kid. It's stories like these that make me feel like an awful piece of shit when I peruse clothing stores in my free time. (This is in addition to: child labor stories, racism in the fashion industry, and so on.) - However, at the same time, I wonder if the fashion realm also has the stigma of being more frivolous than others because it is typically associated with women's interests. And often, women's interests/hobbies are seen as ...not as "serious"? I remember watching this movie called "The Dutchess", where Kiera Knightly's character was explaining that (in the past, before we were allowed to expand beyond our traditional gender roles), "Men [had] so many ways to express themselves in the world, whereas women only [had] fashion." I am sorry if this comes off as a bit ramble-y. Thoughts on this? How do you reconcile things in your head when it comes to these topics? 
Hi team, I was browsing AskReddit thread about unsubstantiated theories when I came across this theory about fashion. &gt;Fashion doesn't enhance attractiveness a lot of the time, but it still serves an actual evolutionary purpose. It proves to other females that you are trustworthy and pay attention to group norms, so you will be supported by the tribe. It proves to males that you are good at gathering the right things that your tribe considers worth having. It also shows that you care enough about others to make an effort to present yourself appropriately, and will likely continue to care. TL:DR Fashion shows that you are a good evolutionary risk. I thought it'd make for an interesting discussion. Do you agree? Disagree? Please try to read others' opinions and reply to them, so we can have a conversation, instead of just posting your own opinion at the bottom!

Talking to you all is a highlight of my day, and I hope to continue to be a helpful voice for you and hopefully meet more of you at our future meetups! 
After shopping at JCrew factory and other stores with my husband, it was made abundantly clear that not only do the men get better quality, but the selection was much better. Are there brands/things that you always buy from the men's section. If so, how much lower in size do you go? 
Do you have a new clothing item you don't know how to wear? No idea what to wear to a wedding/interview/date? Unsure how to accessorize an outfit? Then your questions belong here! Post below to receive advice and feedback. 
Hello hello! I am again posting from mobile, although this time it's due to lack of internet access...anyway, I'm sure y'all know the guidelines by now. Post away! :) 
Shoes, dresses, shorts, button ups. I'm really interested in the number of different articles of clothing you guys have! 
About once a month I have to dress up for client-facing swanky events at work. I'm small but I'm squishy. I want something that will smooth me out under clingy skirts without creating more rolls (looking at you, awful panty girdle contraption with a weird bikini cut that gives me quad butt). I've yet to find any thing in a department store that fits at all. Things are either too large (either the "small" isn't very small or the sizing begins at medium because apparently I don't need shapewear if I'm petite?) Or things are cut oddly. Ideally I would like a panty girdle like thing with either a very full coverage rear or a thong cut, maybe, or an open bottom (like, super retro style) but I mainly want it to smooth me out, not necessarily nip me in. If nipping in is a necessary evil I can maybe deal with that on a small scale. Function trumps style. For reference, my measurements are 36, 25, 38. I have a bit of a lower belly pooch and wide hips, weigh about 120. Roughly 5'3". Good deal of squish. Any thoughts? Thoughts on smaller shapewear in general? Shapewear specifically for petites, maybe? Thanks! 
Last night after dinner with some extended family near a large area mall my SO and I decided to go into Nordstrom to check out their bra selection. One of my best friends is having a boob crisis and so I'm going with her to a different Nordstrom on Saturday so she can get fitted and get some good bras, so I figured it'd be smart to double check their selection while I was near one. We wandered into the lingerie section and I was looking about, trying to get a feel for where things were when an older woman associate approached me and asked, "Can I show you anything?" I really was just there to look, but I was having trouble finding the larger sizes so I asked if they had anything in a 44DD. She looked through a nearby rack for a little while and then just goes, "I think 44 is too big for you." I explained to her that I had been professionally measured and that I wear a 44D or 44DD (the easier to find sister size of a 38G) depending on style. "No, no, that's too big for you," she said. She pulled out a 40D and said, "Let's try this one." Now I had no intention of trying anything on at that moment, and was super gross from walking outside in the humidity. I told her that, but she kept pushing for me to try it on. I told her I'd come back another time and she just kept saying, "But you're here now. I will help you." Eventually I gave in. I don't know why, I probably should have been more forceful. I just felt really pressured and panicked I guess. So she takes me into a fitting room. I take off my shirt and I ask her how my current bra fit, which she didn't really respond. Instead she measured my band size and said, "Yes, 42." She didn't take any other measurements though, which I thought was weird considering all the measurements I had to do for /r/ABraThatFits and how it was done when I was professionally measured. Then I took off my bra, in front of this random saleswoman, and she put the new one on me from the front. It was weird. The bra didn't fit at all. "Let's try a 42," she said. She didn't talk about cup sizes at all, but I am pretty sure she was talking about a D. Which, considering I wear a 44D/DD, I knew was not right. But she left me, holding my bra in place in the fitting room, while she went to go get a 42D. She came back five minutes later with another single bra (why don't they bring multiples if they aren't sure about sizing?!) for me to try on. I tried it on and it was really snug; I was overflowing the cups and the band was very tight. I said, "I don't think this is right. It's really snug. I feel like I could jump in the air for hours and nothing would move even a little." She told me that's how it was supposed to fit. But it was highly uncomfortable and felt like it was pulling my shoulders down, so I knew that wasn't right. By that point I was able to actually convince her that I wanted to leave and she let me. I hurried out of there asap. Basically I find it weird that she pressured me into something that's kind of a weird experience for a lot of people (like I was fine, but I also had not planned on doing that that day so I felt much more uncomfortable than had it been my intention to get fitted), that she only took one measurement, that she never asked me about my style preferences, that she only brought one bra at a time, that I wasn't allowed to put the bras on without her help (why can't I put it on myself so I don't have to show her my boobs and then she can just check for fit when it's on?), and that she didn't seem to know proper fit. I'd heard good things on here about Nordstrom's bra fitting services so I am kind of confused about if this is normal or if it's an anomaly or what. I'm a little worried about bringing my friend to one (albeit a different location), because knowing her she will be even more uncomfortable than I was being topless in front of and helped into a bra by a stranger. So was this a normal experience at Nordstrom or was that sales lady a dud? **tl;dr:** Sales lady at Nordstrom pressured me into trying on bras that weren't even close to the right size for me, didn't seem to measure me correctly, and made me all around uncomfortable. Is that normal? 
As we know, lots of trends only take tall, thin frames in consideration. I'm petite (read: short), half Chinese, with a big ass, big thighs, flat belly, little waist, medium chest, and fleshy arms (34-24-36). If I look for "curvy girl styles" on pinterest/tumblr, I tend to see plus size models rocking tall girl fashion. The only girls I see with my body type are girls in hip-hop videos, and while I adore their styles, it's not exactly practical in my city. As I have such big legs, if I wear a baggy top, I tend to look as if I'm just big all over. But if I wear baggy pants, I'm hiding my best assets. So I tend to wear short shorts and skin tight tops, which often attract too much attention. :/ Does anyone with a similar body type have any tips on how to dress to flatter your shape? 
So I'll probably be moving out next year, living on campus. I'm a bit selfconcious of how many clothes I own. I don't own a lot. Only because I'm a tight ass (I'm not rich by any means either) and I tend to 'evolve' my fashion style. I think just now I've come to a peak in my style where I feel happy in my clothes and think they are in fashion and look alright. Not perfect, but I'm building from here. But since I've JUST coming to a peak in my style, the clothes from a couple of years ago IMO look horrid, which leaves me with a small amount of outfits and clothes. I'm just wondering what's an acceptable number of outfits uni students have? I know people won't judge, but I seriously have maybe 4 outfits currently, and want to build that to an acceptable number haha. And what about party outfits? How many outfits are acceptable? Pretty much I just don't want people going "wow she's wearing that again". So help me out here if you can! 
I often lurk in r/malefashionadvice and noticed that techwear isn't really discussed in r/femalefashionadvice. Personally, I'm a fan and I'd like to minimize/change my wardrobe a bit, but I find it difficult to find flattering pieces specifically catered toward women. Most websites I've come across seem to cater mainly toward young adult men. The most tech-y clothing pieces I own include and tops from Uniqlo, and the [Women's Daily Riding from Outlier. I'm a 5' college student, so anything that caters to petite women and is relatively affordable (for me, that's around $300 for an item I absolutely love and cannot live without) gets bonus feel-good points. What are your thoughts about this trend? And if you're into it, do you have any brand/clothing recommendations? [For those who are interested but aren't well-acquainted with the &gt; Technical clothing is any garment that, through advanced fabric, treatment, cut, or construction, provides a function beyond hiding nudity. Some older examples of technical clothing that you may recognize are, traditional or heritage garments like rubber boots and waxed jackets, and armed forces uniforms. Some newer examples are hiking gear and sports/athletic clothes. Techwear or Urban Techwear, is a subset of technical clothing with an aesthetic that is contemporary or futuristic, fashionable/stylish, and is designed specifically for your common city-dweller's day-to-day situations. This definition excludes other types of technical clothing for various reasons. Heritage items are excluded because Techwear strives to have a modern, contemporary appearance, and has generally improved upon heritage garments. True armed forces gear is mostly excluded because you'll look ridiculous cosplaying as a soldier. Edit: details details details 
Post something for which you would like to find some inspiration (ex.office summer looks) or just post some looks that inspire you! P.S. Do you guys have a preference for a different day for me to post this thread? I have crazy meetings on Wednesdays. 
When I put together an outfit, I'm hesitant to have more than one stand-out piece. I tend to think of everything as a stand-out piece, though, so that's why I'm having trouble dressing. An amethyst corduroy blazer jacket; a bright yellow handbag; grey, argyle-printed peep-toe heels; a black-and-white houndstooth miniskirt; teal wool military-style winter coat; a black velour newsie; all of these things individually look like attention grabbers to me. Whether it's the bold color or texture or something else, it draws the eye. So I'd hesitate to wear the purple jacket with the argyle heels, or the houndstooth skirt with the yellow bag, or the teal coat with the black hat, or the heels with the bag or the jacket with the skirt. I feel that if I wear one of these pieces, everything else should be plain, cotton, bland. And we won't start on how my hair (long, thick, black, curly/frizzy) is also a stand-out. Or the jewelry I like to make/buy in excess! Am I being too conservative? Should I learn to get over this and try mixing two pieces together? What are the thoughts on this? 
Hi FFA! Over at MFA, we do a weekly 'what shoe are you wearing today' thread. As always, we'd like to invite you to join in the fun. Follow the link to post in the thread. 
Hi FFA! I've been lurking for a while and wanting to update my wardrobe a bit. I was browsing MFA when I found this post. I really like the style, and want to translate it into my own wardrobe but I'm not sure how to. Any ideas on where to start and what I should get? I know to build with basics. So far the things I have for basics that fit well are: -A medium wash pair of blue skinnies -A white button down shirt similar to the Portofino from Express -A pair if black ankle booties I've got other things that I like, and that fit well, but aren't necessarily basics. Also, if it helps, I'm 5'2 and weigh about 105 lbs. I would appreciate any info about what to buy/where to begin with this. I'm currently working on building a usable Pinterest board since my old one didn't provide much practical inspiration. Also, I live in Canada so availability can sometimes be an issue. Hopefully I'm not breaking any rules. Thank you so much!! 
I'm going to be attending college in Boston next year, and I'm currently in the process of trying to consolidate / update my wardrobe for the weather. Being from the southeast / south, I'm not used to super cold in the winter and mild in the summer weather. I consider myself fashion forward and with trends, so I don't shy away from much! I'm mostly worried about winters. How can I stay stylish but warm? Any wardrobe suggestions for any season in Boston would be super helpful. Thank you! 
HEY GUYS. I hope this still works for most people. CAN I GET A HEADCOUNT???? I will post a thread on the day of and let you guys know where I'm sitting. I'm planning on arriving at 5pm. ALSO is anyone willing to swap numbers with me and arrive somewhat early??? It would just make me feel better if I had a buddy. 
Hello! I basically only own two pairs of shoes for non-snowing weather (I live in Montreal) - sneakers and flip-flops. It's the summer and I don't really have any friends and so I don't leave the house except for errands or running. But, I am visiting my friend in New York for a few days!! Two nights, and one full day, and one morning. My friend is very stylish so I def need to step up my game. A few things ... 1. My calves are disproportionately large for my body. They're probably the body part I'm most insecure about.. (pics I've searched all around for recommendations (including here), but it's basically all what NOT to wear (no stopping at the ankle - so no booties, no ankle straps, no small heels...etc). The only thing TO wear is heels, which I've accepted. I used to wear heels a lot in high school but that wasn't any walking except between classes. I am not good at walking with heels in cities. Wedges, I can do though! Flats like ballet flats and oxfords I think look good on girls with thin legs, but make me look so stocky and I'm really insecure in them. I like my because of that little dip in the side -- it extends the leg line. They're also large/big, and I think they make my legs look smaller in comparison. These two trends I never notice in non-sneakers though. :/ 2. I will wear the shoes for walking around the city, going out to eat, and going to parties. Also, I'm 20 years old. 3. Here are some photos of the outfits I plan on wearing, or at least showing what my "style" is: 4. I only have tomorrow to buy them!! The closest store near me with a good variety of not old lady shoes is Charlotte Russe - do you think you can give me some ideas [from their If you have any other ideas in mind, that'd be great too! 5. Last thing -- I'm prone to blisters (literally have skin discoloration on my heels and pinky toes from years and years of constant blistering). I guess I will just wear band-aids BEFORE I start to wear them. Still, really stiff shoes (like, most of them I've noticed..?) and I do not have a history of getting along. :/ Tiny rant: My friend is about 5'4-5'5 and 100lbs, and can wear shoes like and make them look soo fashionable and cool. I hate shoe shopping because everything except the tallest heels make my legs look so short and stocky. :/ Does anyone else feel this way? Thanks so much!! &lt;3 
Title says it all. I have the shoulders of a quarterback, to the point where it hinders my clothing choices. I can be a medium or a small, but my shoulders make me a large! Have any of you ladies ever dealt with this problem? I'm going to go crazy if I have to wear tents for shirts and dresses. 
I have an interview at a bridal salon on Monday- nothing crazy, part time work assisting the consultants, but their general dress code is (I believe) business professional. I'm not sure where to start- does this require a suit, or is a high quality dress with a blazer and heels acceptable? I also have a slightly funky haircut/color, so I'd like to tone that down as much as possible, as far as the interview goes at least. Info- I'm 5'6, around 155, 38-28-38, and on a college budget but with a little extra to spend on "investment" pieces right now, say $100 per piece? Any info would help. Thank you so much! 
Alright good people of FFA, I had an accident today at work. I have a laid back office job and today a whiteboard fell on my sandled toes. My toenails on the 3rd and 4th toes on my left foot are extremely damaged and the bone is shattered at the tip. As of now, I am in a lot of pain and am planning for the next couple weeks. Getting to the point, my doctor told me that I need to find new shoes to wear to protect my toes from further damage. I need something with a larger (preferably rubber) toe box so the shoe does not touch my toes. It also needs to be a slip on shoe so the toes don't get caught while putting them on and taking them off. My doctor suggested a style like [this I'm not in love with them, especially at the $100 price point. So before I committed to something, I thought I'd see if anyone had a better suggestion. Thank you!!!!!! 
Apparently no one in San Francisco wears slacks? Skinny jeans and dressy tops are the norm in most businesses--from what I've seen at the three places I've been interviewing. How do you keep your skinny jeans from looking like they just walked off a high school campus? 
Hi Everyone, Long time lurker, first time poster. I have a ball coming up and the theme is "Diamond" due to the business being around for 60 years. My thoughts immediately went to Classic Hollywood Glamour. The below is where I have begun my search, and I have the feeling I have split it into two different looks. Classic: [Badgley Mishka I was attracted to this as it is a classic look and accentuates the models curves, which is something I would like to do. [Badgley Mishka This one made me think of Joan from Mad Men but I am kind of concerned that it may not 'suit' me due to my measurements. The more Period Specific: [Sabrina I saw this and thought of Audrey in Sabrina, and upon googling found that was released in 1954, so close enough. I also saw and kind of fell in love with it but am not sure if it would suit. It does remind me of the 50's though and those semi-gaudy floral dresses. For reference, I am 165cm (5'5) and my measurements are 38-30-40. I am in the process of losing weight, but have always maintained a similar ratio, even when I was at my smallest (36-27-36, *sigh*). I am based in Australia and would prefer to hire, but am happy to buy provided it's under approx $200AUD. Anyways, happy to provide any further info if required, but basically just looking for ideas or feedback to the above. Thanks in advance! 
Hello /r/femalefashionadvice, I'm asking for help not for myself but for my fiancée, who has been having a difficult time as of late finding work clothes. She's been stressed feeling like everybody at the office is dressing better than her and she's rotating too few pieces of clothing. She's not a redditor and also doesn't know I'm doing this but I think (I hope) I know enough to answer any questions. Here's the issue: She has no luck with trips to the department stores, and hours browsing shopping sites turn up fruitless. She's searching for primarily blouses/tops in an 'in between' range. She doesn't want to throw money at cheap pieces that won't last, yet the good items she finds are out of her price range (which I would say is around the $150 mark) I'll spit out some facts here that I think may be relevant to aiding in assistance: * It's an office/cubicle job, business/business casual dress. Her wardrobe consists of dark slacks, flats, wedges, blouses, blazers, and sweaters (most of which are out of the rotation now during the summer) * Her body type, if I'm reading the sidebars correctly, would be 'ruler'. * She doesn't do skirts/dresses, nor any jewelry beyond simple earrings and a necklace. Any resources or advice that can be recommended would be *tremendously* appreciated. **I'll do my best to answer any questions**. It's my hope of hope that someone here knows of a place that sells quality tops at a respectable price. However I know how much that hope sounds like "in a perfect world". Even if you want to spit a list of links for me to refer to her, that'd be great. I've already done that with some sites I've found here (and found she already visits them :/ ). It honestly breaks my heart to see her distressed about what she's going to wear in the upcoming week and even worse because it's something I can't do anything to directly fix. But if all I *can* do is to ask for the help from a really wonderful area like this, then damnit I'll do so. 
I'm a 25-year old traveling to Florida this week, it'll be my first time in the US, very exciting! I'm from northern Europe and it's around +20° celsius here now, so I'm used to colder weather even in summer. I lived in Thailand for 1,5 years so I kind of know what it's like to live in hot climate, but I'm wondering if Florida will be different. I like to dress casually (shorts, tshirts, tops) and wear flipflops/sandals. Is this okay in Miami? I read it's rainy season now so I will be bringing an umbrella. What about when clubbing? A dress, high heels, nothing too fancy? I always imagine Miami people being fashionable and I certainly am not, I always go for comfortable clothing rather than fashionable. Anything else I need to know? 
I've recently transitioned from being ~103 pounds heavier (I've lost over 110 inches), and I have no idea how to dress. My style used to be jeans and a tshirt, and while I was still very curvy when I was bigger, I've recently realized how that style just hides my body in baggy material. I'm trying now to completely get away from it. I've made a lot of progress in that aspect, but I'm finding that I don't really have much else in my closet to wear. My issue with summer clothing is... my upper arms need covered, and the feeling of skinny jeans nearly makes me want to die. I can do compression leggings when I workout without an issue though. I also can't bring myself to wear shorts or anything shorter than a Capri. I used to walk to the biggest sizes I could find and settle for something (the cheaper the better). My clothes have never really fit my body right, so I never had a passion for looking not-homeless. Over the past two weeks, I have been able to do a little shopping. I bought two pair of jeans that actually fit my body, a tapered cardigan thing with long sleeves, a couple shirts from Cato (you know the kind with the illusion of an undershirt, and a low draped neck line), and a hooded short sleeve tunic from Maurices. The tunic was the game changer. I had never actually been in Maurices, but spotted it and I had to have it. I left after talking myself out of spending $35, walked back in, tried it on, and left with a size smaller than I thought I needed. And I love it. I don't have female friends where I live, and I have no idea what I'm doing as far as dressing myself is concerned. Any suggestions for places to shop and styles that may work well for me? Oh, and shoes? I have NO idea what to put on my feet other than Nike flip flops and NB running shoes, neither of which actually look good outside my house. I'm a mess. Help! 
I am moving to Nebraska in the fall to go to school. I am from the Mid-Atlantic area, so not only is the Mid-West culture still new to me but so are the winters! I am used to very mild winters, it usually hovers around freezing and we rarely get big storms or high winds. From what I have heard from people on campus and in the area, the weather (wind especially) can be pretty brutal! I have a puffer jacket but it is old and thinner then I would like. I also need warm winter boots (or at least socks that can fit inside my current boots). If anybody has some suggestions, please reply! I need help from people who KNOW the winters in the midwest. What are the essentials? 
I feel so overwhelmed at what to pack for an upcoming trip to NY at the end of August. I'll be staying in Manhattan with my cousin, I've never been to NY. I'll only be there for 4 days but I want to look fabulous (at least not like an obvious tourist who is trying too hard) I'm 5'10" and was hoping to look sleek without heels (in the evenings out for drinks I will suffer) I do wear a lot of black in my day to day life. Any tips or inspiration? 
Hi everyone, I'll be going to Vegas in August for five days. I've never been before, and I'm really excited! However, I'm nervous about the extreme heat and the wardrobe situation. I really like all of the people I will be going with (they are great!!), but I am not as in-shape, petite, or trendy as they are. I'd really like to feel confident about myself on the trip, and I'm hoping you can help me. I am 5'8, pear-shaped, and about 180 lbs. Luckily for me I still have a small waist and decent bust, but I carry a lot of the weight in my legs, which I typically cover up with maxi dresses or dark jeans because I am also naturally very pale. I also have issues with upper-thigh rub, and I typically will wear a shaper or shorts underneath to combat it. That's just not going to work well in Vegas' 110 degree August heat. I've been hitting the gym and watching what I eat to tone up as much as I can, but I have realistic expectations for what can be accomplished. I'm considering getting a spray tan, which I have done for trips before and really liked the look of. I know we'll be going to see Britney, going out clubbing at least one night, and hanging out by the pool a LOT. I desperately need advice for: - Swimsuit(s?) that will be flattering - Maybe some sort of chic cover-up for the pool? - An appropriate outfit to wear for Britney Thank you so much in advance, everyone. 
Any suggestions for a backpack to be used as a diaper bag? Criteria: 1) has a laptop section (where I will actually put the diapers), and several other pockets 2) does not look silly on a mid-30's woman 3) does not look comically small on me at 5'7 and currently between USA size 14-16 4) pockets need to be secure enough so that stuff can't fall out of them 5) is definitely more of a backpack than a "diaper bag-y" diaper bag. I personally dislike these type of bags - 6) Price range up to $175 ish I have been using a MZ Wallace bag and I've been very happy with it but after 3 years of heavy use and baby #2 it's time for something new. This is what I have been using, in a tan color: Any ideas? Edit: to clarify, I don't need to carry very much stuff. Just diapers, wipes, my own wallet, sunscreen, some snacks, and a sippy cup or water bottle. Also, I like the rucksack-style of backpacks, like the ones from Moop and Everlane, but those 2 look a little too low-profile for my size 
So I've been searching for a while. I've got a small (24 inch/61 cm) waist and wide-ish (88cm/just under 35 inches) hips at the widest, but every garter belt I've ordered online has slid too far down over my hips and rump and I feel like I have to keep reaching under my skirt to tug at it and keep my stockings up. Even when shops have measurements to follow, it seems that I'm either not within them, or on the low enough end that it doesn't work. I'm hoping to find something that is pretty enough that I *want* to wear it every day and heavy duty enough that it can actually hold up my silk stockings. I'm willing to spend up to $75 USD, but I AM just now entering the work force as a young twenty-something and so I want something that will last and do the job. If I have to save up for a few months to get something *really* fantastic, it's within the realm of possibility but I'm hoping someone has an excellent solution before it comes to that. 
I'm so unhappy with my wardrobe right now, especially since starting a higher end retail job. I'm trying to be fiscally responsible about buying new items and possibly trying to sell what I do have that's nice. My wardrobe just feels claustrophobic at this point. There's just...too many things. Do you find it easier to wait it out in the off chance you can sell some of it or stuff it all into garbage bags and take it to Goodwill? 
So a relative is getting married soon, and I thought I'd use the wedding as an excuse to buy [this Alice &amp; Olivia which I've been in love with for months. It was $700 when it came out, and the only retail stores that have it now are not in my size and ~$800. However, my friend found these two listings on Ebay; The issue is, I'm like 50% sure they're fakes. I was comparing official photos to the pictures the sellers took, and in the sellers' photos the cherries start further down from the waist than in the official photos. I thought maybe this was a style variation, but in every legitimate seller's photos (ex. ) I could find, the cherries start near the waist. The only seller I could find who pictured the cherries starting further down the waist, like in the Ebay sellers' pictures, was [this Asian I have no idea if it's legitimate, but it seems weird to me that that was the only source I could find for the dress in this variation. The two explanations I came up with were: 1. there's a different manufacturer for the brand's clothing sold in Asia, and the Asian site + ebay are variations, or 2. the Asian site &amp; Ebay listings are all fakes. Anyone better at this than me have some advice? Should I just call the brand? Alternatively, what do you guys think about the and variations? I was considering one of those instead, but the cherries are the best imo. 
The party starts off outside in someones backyard and some people will be camping after. I just can't decide what the best option is to wear! I would normally dress up but since its going to start off outside I feel like I will be over dressed. I want to wear a dress so I was thinking a maxi dress, but would that look ok at a bar? To be honest I don't go to bars so I am clueless. Oh and I'm 29 if that matters :) Thanks in advance! 
I recently purchased a t-shirt dress from Brandy Melville and put it through the washing machine, but hung it up on a drying rack per the tag instructions. However, when I put it on after it dried, it was 3-4 inches shorter than usual. Any suggestions on how to stretch it out or is it a lost cause? :( Thanks! 
I'm a mess! I just picked up three in the colors and styles shown. I am **not** a fashionable person, and this felt like a big purchase to me, but I have a lot of weddings coming up. That said, I need some heels to match! As I **never, ever, ever** wear heels, nor do I want to spend money on buying a lot of different ones, I'd **ideally in a perfect frickin' world** want just one shoe that can multitask all three of these. Any ideas? * Some quirks about me: I hate my feet. Really hate them. Don't want to look at them ever. Was looking into the cage-style shoe to cover them up but I don't know if it would match well. Edit: Ballet flats are no go because of the problem above. 
"The "Should I Or Shouldn't I Buy..." Thread will be posted every Saturday morning. This thread is to ask the community about purchases you're not entirely sure about - questions like "I saw these great mint jeans on sale, but is it too late into fall to be worth it?" or "How does this Polyvore Set look" belong here." 
~~The last post on ethical fashion in this sub was 2 years ago, so I thought I would open up a few questions.~~ This year, I am doing a capsule wardrobe each season, and I made a commitment to only buy ethically produced fashion or secondhand. It hasn't been as hard as I anticipated, but I'm getting bored halfway through the year and wanted to hear y'alls opinions. NO JUDGEMENT if you don't care about this issue or don't shop with these issues in mind...seriously no judgement. Just curious, for those who do: 1) What things are most important to you in ethical fashion production: environmental impact, child labor, fair wages, etc? 2) What are some of your favorite brands that have made a commitment to ethical production? 3) Are there any brands you want to believe but still have questions about? Anybody who works for a brand who can speak to ethical issues in that company? Here are my answers: 1) Human rights and child labor. Especially for kids' clothes...the thought of my (future) kids wearing clothes made by other children in slavery or poor working conditions makes me so sick and sad. Fair labor laws, fair wages, and ISO standards are huge for me. 2) Everlane, Naja, Aritzia, Hackwith Design House, and Peopletree 3) Whew. • Madewell is my all-time favorite brand...literally 2/3 of my closet is from them. J Crew brands have [this on social responsibility, but I've also read that J Crew brands are not squeaky clean in their supply chain management. • Cos has [this about their ethics policy, but again, they're owned by H&amp;M, which is well known to have some issues. Which brings me to: • H&amp;M Conscious Collection. Having a "Conscious Collection" is basically admitting that anything outside that collection has ethical issues, no? So what does that say about the company as a whole, including their subsidiary brands like Cos? Super curious if anyone has advice about other great brands or info about my "questionable" list!! Edit: I tried to search but the more recent post didn't come up, so sorry for the repeat post!! I didn't see the last one :/. Thanks for helping me out even though I suck at searching haha!! 
Hi guys, trying to gather some of your best laundry tricks. Right now I have a top with what I believe is an oil stain on it - haven't washed or dried yet, any advice on that? Totally interested in other ideas too, tips on getting wine stains out, or best ways to air dry, etc? What's your routine? 
So I'm turning 23 at the end of this month, and just got my first "adult" office job a few months ago. Since then I feel like I've been battling 2 identities but not fitting in with either. I've been the black sheep of my family since I was 13, diving head first into some (cringey) punk/gothy looks and parts of it still stick with me. Old habits die hard and whatnot. Right now I feel like the odd one out at my office and pretty much everywhere else, and I'm so sick of feeling this way. I have piercings/tattoos that I mostly hide at work, but I can't nail down a style I feel comfortable with. Just want to note that I love my tattoos and my piercings are pretty tame/unnoticeable nowadays. I usually stick to black pants and a dressy shirt, which sounds fine but me being white as a sheet with naturally dark hair still makes me look like a damn witch half the time. My breaking point was going to see family at the beach on short notice - realizing I had nothing to wear but a black and white striped skirt, nothing less than combat boots/heels, no bathing suit I'd even think about wearing because I stick out like a sore thumb at the beach. I wanted to cry when some old guy came up to me and said "hey my son would like you, he's into all that dark stuff." But then there are times I feel like I'd be giving up my whole look and would feel just as uncomfortable with a different style. So in short - I've been reading through the color guide/swimwear on the side bar and it's definitely helping a little. Does anyone have any stories like this that successfully turned their look around? Any encouragement about completely stepping out of your comfort zone? TL;DR - Sick of looking the teenage goth queen that can't figure it out. Any advice? Edit: This picture is my life right now: 
I posted a little bit about this yesterday in Random Fashion Thoughts thinking I was the only one feeling this way, and got enough of a response to think that I'm probably not the only one feeling this way, so I'm starting a discussion on it because I think it's an interesting topic, and perhaps even an important one. I've noticed that, especially recently, there has been a real surge in criticism of women with more femme body types wearing styles of clothing not made to flatter the body or create a traditionally femme shape. (I'm going to use the term femme here because generally the body type I'm talking about would be described as "womanly" but I hate that term because being a woman has nothing to do with a shape.) I don't know if this is just because people are more critical of bodies in the summer or what, but I have noticed it and it's bothering me a bit. I feel that there is a mentality that if you have a certain body type you should HAVE to wear clothes that flatter it. There seem to be two schools of thought on why this is. I've heard people say it's a "waste of a good body" and I've also heard people say that drapey clothes look "frumpy and lazy" on a femme figure. I'd really like to see some discussion on this topic and hear what people feel about it. I have several specific questions, and I'm very interested to hear any other ideas you ladies have on the subject. :) a) If you have a femme shape, should you be obligated to flatter it? b) Should female fashion be focused on flattering? c) Do clothes automatically look better if they flatter the body? d) Is there a push against women with femme body shapes wearing certain types of clothes? Since this is how I dress and the body shape I have, I definitely have feelings on the matter, but I'm going to put them in a comment below, so as to leave this concise. 
I finally caved and got a Pinterest board because too often do I go shopping and buy individual pieces without a holistic view of how I'm going to wear them... and then I end up never wearing them and giving them away. :( Here are some of the outfits I've pinned: Questions: * What is this style called, if anything? Is it "street"? A label isn't particularly important to me but will help when I'm searching online. * If you haven't noticed, all of these outfits coincidentally ended up being geared towards fall weather haha. It's my favorite season if you couldn't tell. How do I "convert" this style into warm weather fashion?? I live in a state that gets all 4 seasons. * Are there any particular stores, brands, or blogs you'd recommend for more ideas? Thanks in advance for any help you can provide! 
I'm a 23 year old beginning my student teaching in September, so I've been trying to buy clothes that are teacher appropriate. Because I'm short and pretty young, I'm afraid of blending in with students. However, I now feel like everything I buy lacks any sort of style or trendiness because I'm trying to buy things that are practical and conservative (i.e. Plain blouses and button ups, the typical black dress pants or khakis, black flats). Does anyone have any cute, teacher-friendly outfit advice for me? 
Weekly dealz time! Sorry this week I am on mobile and don't have the time/ability to efficiently post the guidelines or my usual mall brands. But have at it! 
I actually just joined reddit, to ask everyone that is into fashion, of this specific question. A colleague of mine showed me this shirt, and I was confused a little. It looks very appealing, but is it worth going organic? It's a cute piece of shirt. Or I just might be crazy to buy it. This is where I found it, if anyone's curious. 
ran this article recently and I was wondering how other FFAers, especially plus sized ones like me, feel about it. I'm glad that plus sized options may expand. But I'm also kind of taken aback by the phrase "[...] and even skinny jeans" as if bigger girls shouldn't usually wear them. 
Hi everyone! I have been lurking FFA for a while and I find myself thinking more and more about what I wear. I am hoping to start getting involved in WAYWT (once i get a big enough mirror!). I am in the middle of moving house so I am wading through my extensive wardrobe. I am very lucky as my size hasnt fluctuated much in the last 10 years (Im 27) so I have accumulated a lot of things, I do throw stuff out regularly but I am also an avid shopper. I have noticed lately that I have a definite look. skinny trousers or jeans, sleeveless floaty blouse, round neck cardigan, court shoes (sometimes flat pumps). As I said I have a lot of stuff but I gravitate to repeating the same ideas. does anyone else find themselves doing this? if so is it because you don't have the means (knowledge, wardrobe, budget) or because you lack the confidence to mix it up? I have found myself wondering if this style of outfit does in fact suit me! Does anyone else have a crisis of confidence like this?! all opinions much appreciated :-) 
I am going to Boston/Upstate New New York next week. I am from California. I'm attending a weekend wedding with no dress code, which I think I have locked down as more than a few west coasters will be attending... But I have some money to spend and would like to know what types of clothing would be appropriate for summer wear over there? I don't really have summer appropriate pieces because I'm in the midst of losing weight. We'll probably be doing touristy things - so walking will be a part of the experience. I am currently a size 10/12 and while I don't carry weight in any specific area, I don't love my legs and so really short shorts are out. Edit: to be kinder about short shorts. 
My sister is moving from Chicago to Hawaii and is having a bit of a crisis over what to bring. She wants to avoid buying new things for awhile, at least until she's settled in. I feel like she has a lot to choose from and is just having a hard time figuring out how to narrow it down. She asked for my advice, but I literally know nothing about Hawaii other than the weather is usually way nicer than in Chicago and people say things are much more expensive there. Any advice on good items to bring? Things that will go well with the climate and culture? Are certain items way more expensive/harder to find there? 
First post here! I read the rules and I'm sure this is the right place, if not please excuse me. I am 22 and trying to find my style. A perfect outfit to me is a tight grey crop top, high waist black skinny jeans, ankle boots, and an oversize jacket/cardigan. Or something all white. Anyways I feel like I can't wear these things until I'm thinner (I'm losing weight). I also feel like certain things just come out being sexy when I don't want them to be regardless of fit. For example, I am a very curvy pear with thick thighs and large bottom. ALL shorts appear sexy. And don't get me started on pencil skirts. I guess I'm just wondering do any other young women feel this way? What do you think when you see a curvier (about a US size 9) woman in certain clothing? EDIT: I have read ALL comments and I am grateful for everyone's input. It's very refreshing, relieving, and exciting to read so many empowering view points. I'm telling my boyfriend now about all of the kind strangers on reddit and how I'm buying those high waisted skinny jeans next week lol. Thank you thank you thank you all so very very much!

How can I start learning to dress better and mature? I'm 21 married and a mom, I look pretty young and I dress like it because I just don't know how to change my style. And also I can never find anything that looks good without breaking get the bank. Please help 
Hi FFA. Every Wednesday we do a "What Shoe are you Wearing Today" thread @ MFA. As usual, we'd like to invite all of you to join in the fun. Follow the link and post a pic of your shoes. 
I like my wardrobe but people often mistake me for someone under 18 (I'm 22.). What are some pieces you saw people wearing and think they can't be pulled off after teen years? 
Like the title says, I'm interested in learning to tailor my own clothes. I'm super poor, but also I hate my whole closet, so I want to attempt thrifting and tailoring to improve my wardrobe without spending a ton of money. I own a sewing machine and know how to use it, so I'm looking more for beginning tailoring resources. I'm up for anything: tops, pants, dresses, etc. Does anyone know of a website, book, YouTube channel, or what have you, that could get me started on the basics of tailoring?

I'm going to be 26 in a few months. Sometimes I feel like I look younger, but in an awkward way. I don't necessary want to look older or super adult-y, but not immature. Are there any suggestions of things that people in their mid-to-late 20s totally should not wear regardless of the circumstances? Is there anythng that becomes appropriate at this age whereas it may have been awkward at a younger age? TBH, I occasionally wear band tees but not as much as I used to - I wear them to shows and for hanging out, but I no longer consider such thing as a "dressy band tee" Lately I've been feeling like I want to dress a bit more feminine and less boyish than I did last year, but I'm having a hard time defining "feminine" within the context of my own tastes. If I think "feminine" I think of something tighter and shorter, or else floofy and demure - neither of which directly appeal to me - but there's probably WAYYY more to it than that. Here's my fall/winter 15 pinterest for taste reference Last year's because this year's one doesn't have much so far TLDR: I used to be "not a girl, not yet a woman" but I'm feeling a bit more woman. How do I woman? 
Thoughts? I can't say I'm surprised. 
I usually only wear black or navy blue suits, recently bought my first tan one. I usually do not see people wearing such a light colored suit, and was wondering whether they are seen as less formal or less appropriate in a professional setting. I personally think lighter suits tend to look more casual. Is there a general consensus on the issue? 
hey girls, I'm visiting my long distance boyfriend in a month and would like to surprise him with sexy lingerie (garter belt, stockings etc). What can I wear over it that would be appropriate on a plane/ grabbing food when I get there? 
I live in India, where we can often find gorgeous fabric that has not yet been turned into a garment or accessory. Today, I found - hopefully the link is view-able! It's 100% silk, handwoven, with a base of a tan/silver-ish silk and then the colours are slubby, uneven and heavily variegated. My husband is getting a vest made out of it, but I never wear vests; the shopowner/tailor suggested a sleeveless blouse or a skirt (...and I never wear skirts. Sigh). I'm evaluating the sleeveless blouse option, but wanted to consult FFA for ideas. It seems more like upholstery fabric, in a way, than intended-as-a-garment material; it would make a great tie, cut on the bias, or possibly even a scarf. I'm 5'4", usually around a size 14-16 in US clothes, bra size somewhere around a 36HH (UK), and my style tends to be pretty basic: jeans + t's in my off-time, black slacks and various button-front shirts when I'm looking professional. I'm a stay-at-home-mom/relief teacher at the moment, with a toddler, so I'm not going corporate every day, but I am occasionally covering classes at the school we live/work at. I tend to do more with my accessories (today I picked up a pair of Tibetan/Nepali earrings - jhumka style - and a Nepali/Tibetan necklace, silver with blue stones. So: sleeveless blouse? Suck it up, get a skirt, and start wearing skirts? Just buy a piece of it, frame it, and stare at the pretty colours? See if I can get a bag made (though I'm nervous about that), or other ideas?

Hi All! I was hoping to get your opinions on wedding dress ideas! I posted over at /r/femalefashionadvice and got a little help is the post. The venue is a brewery in Texas in October and I know the [shoes in and that I want but am having a lot of trouble finding a dress that makes sense stylistically with those pieces. I am thinking something "nude" or camel colored. If it helps, the colors I am using for the wedding decor are ivy and camel. What would y'all suggest? Thank you!!! edit: I am thinking something somewhat casual and knee length, but am open to other ideas too! 
Hi all! As I was reading through A Thousand Splendid Suns, I thought it might be useful to have a discussion of the different types of coverings worn by Muslim women. A few different ones come up in the novel, and if you're unfamiliar with the styles, it can be a bit confusing. The main difference between all of the different styles is what is covered (how much, and what parts of the body). As always, feel free to post corrections if you come across anything incorrect. I'm not an expert, I just looked things up online. But I do have pictures! I'm going to go over the four types of coverings that I hear of most often, the hijab, chador, niqab, and burqa, but there are many more and many variations on these. There are no spoilers in this post. ^^^^^^^^^. [**tl;dr**: look at this [or this #Hijab The hijab is just a headscarf, exposing the face but covering the rest of the head and hair. This is the covering I see most commonly in the US. In some cultures, hair is not fully covered. There are a lot of variations on this one. This is the covering first mentioned in A Thousand Splendid Suns. Pictures: * [A purple (an al amira, more specifically, which is a two-piece hijab). * [A color block * [A white #Chador The chador covers what the hijab covers (head except for face) as well as the body. It's open at the front, but usually clutched closed. Pictures: * [White * [A printed * [Another printed chador, from the #Niqab The niqab covers the entire body, excluding the eyes. (Notably, the mouth and nose are covered; some leave the forehead exposed). Unlike the chador, there is not an opening in the front; this does not need to be clutched to stay closed. Pictures: * [Black * [Pink (bridal?) * [Niqab with hijab in the #Burqa The burqa covers all of the body, including the eyes. The eyes are covered with a coarse mesh-like veil. They come in a few colors, most commonly blue and white. When the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan, they forced women to wear this in public. Pictures: * [Two women in blue * [Black (actually worn by a Jewish woman) * [Women wearing blue and white *** In case you're interested in looking at some more pictures, here are a few of the sources I used: * [This post on the femalefashionadvice subreddit has a lot of great * [This imgur gallery with explanations of the different styles is also * There's a mostly-inactive subreddit called /r/classyhijab that had some good pictures. As you can see, there are a lot of styles of coverings and a lot of variations on even the ones I've listed. If you're interested in learning more, there's lots of visual or written guides you can find with a quick web search. I hope this quick guide was helpful. Enjoy reading!

Here's how it works, we let our subscribers post pictures in a thread for a month, we then compile them into a gallery without filtering any of the content. Due to the nature of how it was compiled, it's hard to pin down a "theme" but I'd say things tend to lie along moto/rugged influence.

8 months ago I asked [what the ugliest shoe you'd ever was and got some great responses. Today I came across and I couldn't stop laughing for about 5 straight minutes. Also the price tag somehow adds to how amazingly bad they are. Have you come across any lately that give these a run for their money? 
/u/elliefunt made a about what's going out of style for the upcoming seasons and /u/clanchet asked for a post about what's going to be in style. A lot of the comments did mention a dying trend and a trend to replace it, but I figured making a separate post would make things easier to find. I don't keep up enough with fashion so I'd like to be more conscious of what I wear this year! 
There's been a lot of really interesting discussion lately-ish about buying clothes/participating in fashion in an ethical way. I found [this which discusses the labor ethics of modern fashion- for example, the specific practices and politics of overseas manufacturing and how they subcontract labor which makes it more difficult to enforce safety standards via inspections, which is a new problem that didn't exist in the early days of the ethical labor controversy (and how the subcontracting practices became more popular in response to increased regulation). This doesn't address any environmental concerns or other ethical issues, but I found it to be really interesting anyways. I'd be really interested to hear what everyone's take on this is! 
I've never really been into fashion. I'm more of a tomboy. Going through school I was a jeans, sneakers, t-shirts and hoodies girl. Now I'm a 28-year-old middle school teacher and I want to put together a more cohesive wardrobe. I've been teaching for five years now and everything's been pretty much a mish mash. I'll find maybe three shirts or sweaters I like and wear them until they wear out (trying to limit them to no more than two or three times a month). I've got a few ankle length skirts I'll wear a few times in the fall before I get sick of them and just alternate between black and tan pants for the rest of the year. For the most part, the things I've found I keep coming back to are polo shirts (usually mens-- I've got big arms/shoulders and don't like the tiny, constricting little sleeves of most womens), quarter zip sweaters, and baggy, roll tab shirts. My boyfriend has his "personal uniform" of earth tone Carhartt pants, tan boots, and earth tone Carharrt t-shirts for home and polos for work. He has only one kind and color of socks and everything from pants to shirts to boots goes with everything else and frankly I'm jealous of how easy it is for him to get ready-- just grab whatever shirt/pants/socks/boots are closest and put them one. No worrying if he wore that shirt last week or if it matches his boots. I want something closer to what my boyfriend has-- easy clothes that pretty much all go together that I can wear without being judged too much (so not all the exact same color every day). My thought for awhile was to stick to the black and tan pants (I'd need to keep a pair each of black and tan shoes for this I think) and a bunch of different, more brightly colored polos (not all earth tones like my boyfriend). But I'm not sure if a female teacher wearing a polo every day would be too weird (I know a lot of the males do it). I thought about button down Oxford shirts, but those were just too uncomfortable for me every day and I stick to wearing them only for special occasions. Any thoughts/advice? 
Hello! I was wondering if I could get some help in the lipstick department. Who doesn't love a good red lipstick? I once found an amazing blue red in Vegas and haven't been able to find a similar colour back home (Australia) and was in need of some help. It looked so beautiful and I would love to find one, any brand is fine. I saw Mac - Ruby Woo on here but I wasn't sure it would suit me. My skin is cool toned which is why I believe the bluish tinge looked good. Can anyone recommend a nice colour? 
Was in /r/femalefashionadvice and they are predicting what is in for Winter, which we are already in the middle of anyway. Are there any aussie websites/bloggers/igs/etc that you use to keep up with aussie trends?

I go to school in the south (USA), and I have never found a great way to style outfits so I won't be left sweating profusely/disgustingly. I like to look a bit more conservatively for class, so no crop-tops or short shorts either. Does anyone have any favorite loose-fitting pants or dresses that help keep you cool? Also, recommendations for shoes or hair accessories would be much appreciated, as well. 
I am bad at fashion so I would like to start small and dress according to what "flatters" my shape, but I can't figure out what it is and I really just want some easy simple rules to follow. I have posted here before but I am still lost so I thought I would try again with more information. I have tried all sorts of calculators and I get boyish, rectangle, pear, cello and hour glass depending on the formula... and of course the rules for each of those shapes are different/conflicting. My measurements are (in inches): shoulders - 45 boobs - 42 bra band - 36 waist - 37 belly - 43 hips - 45.5 1 thigh - 25.5 From armpit to waist - 12.5 From waist to the bottom of butt - 14 Height - 5'11'' Weight - 200 pounds And for the sake of completeness, is an exhaustive album of all the photos I have that show my body. I have tried to be ruthless and not hide anything embarrassing, but note the photos span a decade and range from 170lbs to 210lb. So my shoulders and hips are the same size and I don't have a super defined waist, which leads to the rectangle result but I do have curves, especially when viewed from the side. My boobs are smaller than my hips which leads to the pear results but my boobs are still so big and my shoulders are big so I don't look like the pictures of pears and I definitely don't want to be making my shoulder look bigger. I clearly have a tire around my belly which I would like to hide so I tend to cinch at my waist but the advice for short waists, which I appear to be, is to not draw attention to the waist. Basically I'm lost. Please help! 
It's been a while (I think a year or so) since we've had this discussion, even though some members of the community noted it would be useful to bring the topic back every few seasons or so. Whether you're about to start back-to-school shopping, working towards curating a better wardrobe, or just have general interest in which fashion trends are slowly dying over next year - it'd be fun to hear some input! 
i feel like people are going to think I'm making a joke here, but I swear I'm serious. I'm not a fat person, but I have a pretty shapely butt thanks to weightlifting, and was cursed with some pretty wide child-bearing hips. Yet, when I wear pants, particularly yoga pants or something similar, they don't do that cute, sexy thing where they go up your butt a little bit. I know this sounds ridiculous (you WANT your pants to go up your butt!?!) but I just hate that they sort of just spread out across my ass, giving me the illusion of uni-butt (is this a thing?) I just want my pants to cling to me a little nicer. That's all. 
Hi guys! I have awful luck with jeans. My hips are narrow, my legs are a little large, so I deal with lots of inner thigh holes in my jeans. The priciest I've gone are gap jeans, and those wore out in (not kidding) 5 months. My $80 jeans lasted me 5 months, which sucks since I can't afford clothes usually as a college student. Same problem with express jeans, plus they fit me weirdly and wore out even FASTER. So what now? What other pant materials can I look into for casual wear? How much should I anticipate spending? What tips do y'all have to cut down on wear? How frequently should I wash my jeans? aaaah! 
I remember last year and the nightmare situation with LL Bean duck boots selling out. I had to order a pair of boots from a different company that I was very disappointed with because when I went to check out at the LL Bean store they said my purchase would come in February and I'm pretty sure this was in September... Well it's July and no one is thinking about fall so my boots from LL Bean were not only delivered in two days but I also got them at a discount rate using a gift card through my credit card's cash back offers. I don't want this to feel hail corporatey but I just remember last year's nightmare back order situation. Feel free to list any other items you've had similar seasonal experiences with here. 
We're (more than) halfway through! How's it going? 
Hi! Hope I'm posting in the right place - I'm looking to purchase a pair of 'goes with everything' black sneakers to replace my old ones, which I've worn down completely. I know there are about a billion casual black sneakers in the world, but because of my specifications I've been having a really hard time and have exhausted my shopping options. The issue is that most plain black sneakers (like Keds) make my feet look weirdly long, and I already have pretty long and skinny feet. I'm looking for a sneaker that starts a little lower down on my foot instead of starting right at my ankle, and has a shorter distance between where the laces end and where the toe is. I find that when there is a long distance between where the laces end and where my toe ends, my foot looks longer. Mesh and canvas preferred, but willing to look at anything. I would prefer a sneaker I can wear without socks in the summer, and pair with black tights in the fall with skirts and dresses. Here are sneaker shapes that have worked for me: (These are my original sneakers, that I had in black. I really like the square perforated detail, but don't need to have it again. The length between where the laces end and where the toe ends is moderate, and the larger width of the shoe helped balance it out. They've sold out in black, but I'm looking for a sturdier option anyway, as these wore out very quickly.) (These were almost perfect, but the black was more navy blue in person and I didn't like the look of the side vents or the lime green accents. I figured it would be too obvious they weren't true black when paired with black leggings.) Sneaker shapes that won't work on me: Keds (Bought these and returned them, the shape was really off and not as pictured.) No converse suggestions please - I already own too many of those and am looking for a less wide /rounded toe. Thanks so much in advance!! I'm desperate to find the right pair as it's probably my most used wardrobe staple.

I'm petite (150 cm/4'11"), fairly thin (45kg/100 pounds) and I have a pear body shape. Most professional clothes make me look stumpy. I'm looking for ideas for outfits to wear to work. ETA: Thanks for all the suggestions! I was told by the mods to give more information, so here it is: my measurements are 80-70-90ish (31"-27"-35"). I have really wide hips and upper thighs in proportion with the rest of my body. I also have very child-like features and often get mistaken with a teenager even though I'm 25, so any help making myself look older/my age would also be appreciated! Right now my style is mostly skinny jeans and cute tops with flats or kitten heels since I'm not very good at walking in heels. As for budget, I'm a broke b*tch, but I know good online stores so it's mostly finding a style that makes me look my age and doesn't make me look stumpy. 
Looking for a pair of shoes that look good in the gym and outside of it. I need shoes that work well for lifting, and various bodyweight and resistance exercises, though not cardio. I've seen nike frees mentioned as a more stylish option, but I'm wondering if anyone has any other recommendations. I quite like the look of nike air maxs, but I'm told they're terrible for lifting. Any input would be appreciated, thank you! 
Hi FFA! I have a question about [this I own. My grandmother got it in Ireland as a gift for my dad like 10 years ago. He never really wore it, so when I was in high school I liberated it from his closet and made it my own. It's the perfect slightly-oversized chunky knit. I haven't worn it in a few years because I've been living in a tropical climate, but now I'm moving back to someplace cold so I've brought it back out. Basically, I'm dismayed at how much I wore out this sweater in high school by being careless. There's a lot of and from it getting caught on my rings. The way I see it, I have two options: repair it to look tidy again, or do something to make it look intentionally distressed. Any tips on how to do either of these things / which one is a more viable option? I have a pretty punky/eccentric style so I'm sure I could pull off a distressed look, but I wouldn't know how to do that without unraveling the whole sweater. On the other hand, while the cost per wear is super low by now and I've definitely gotten a lot of good use out of this sweater, a part of me still cringes at the thought of defiling a really high quality garment. Sorry this post was so ramble-y! I appreciate any help! 
The Recent Purchases thread will be posted on Monday mornings (PST) This thread is for sharing all your new buys. Clothes, shoes, razors cologne, share it all. ...Just kidding. But just like MFA, and per your suggestions, we are now going to have a weekly recent purchases thread. So gather round and brag about your purchases! Bags, clothing, shoes, jewelry, perfume, etc. If possible, please share a picture and a little review! 
Sometimes I find myself torn between how I want to present myself: I sort of like a more or less punk (ex. distressed, imperfect, possibly DIY, nothing too perfect, etc.) aesthetic but I also like refined (ex. coordinated, based on upper-class styles, items with associations of "class") aesthetics. Even though I know that someone can spend thousands of dollars to look practically homeless, and "classic" and conservative styles don't have to cost much at all, both styles have associations with certain types of attitudes. I like elements of the "old money prep"/Ivy League style and would love to fuck its shit up and corrupt it with aspects of darker styles, but I feel like I'd be using my style to betray my working-class background and glorify something I don't necessarily care for in terms of values. I'm probably overthinking but has anyone else felt the same: liking aspects of a style but not the associations attached to it? 
I have recently gained some weight, and found that size 14 is really hard - my old go to stores for business attire seem to mostly stop at size 12, and the plus size stores are hit and miss. If anyone has any suggestions, or if there is a different subreddit that would be better for this question, I would be so grateful for info. ETA: my budget is probably up to $400, although of course I'd love to go cheaper if I can. 
Hey. I'm Jean Grae. Rapper, producer, writer, director, comedian, editor, private dancer to the stars, dog groomer, groom groomer. You can go watch the 1st episode of my new sitcom "Life With Jeannie" here and also catch up on everything else I'm doing. Which is EVERYTHING. Books, shows, building castles. Blah, blah. Such everything. Wow. My latest music releases are on BUY ALL OF THAT SHIT. PROOF OF MEEE??? 
I used to work at a gas station that was family owned and operated. I was there for a year and the entire time the dress code was very lax. I wore jeans with holes and rips in them, short shorts, whatever. To top it off, it was in an extremely nice area near a lake and the 1% flocked to this place because it was the only convenience store nearest the lake for beer/soda/candy. One day I came to work in jeans that were about 5 years old. They were so worn out that they used to be tight jeans, but were baggy as hell and had rips on both knees. (Yaaaay minimum wage) The regulars there were "quirky". One came in just like he does every day and grabs a 40 oz of Busch. As he gets to the counter, I stop stocking sodas and meet him at the register. "Hi, how are you tod--" "You are so stupid for buying those jeans like that." "I'm sorry... What?" "You have got to be kidding me! You are so dumb! *So* stupid!" "I didn't buy my jeans like this... I've had them for years and worn them a lot..." "NO YOU DIDN'T! YOU BOUGHT THOSE JEANS LIKE THAT." At this point I'm getting angry. This rich bastard is insulting my intelligence because he's never seen what well worn clothes look like in his life. "NO. I DIDN'T. Who the hell would buy jeans THIS jacked up?! The zipper is LITERALLY held together by a KEYRING!" He shakes his head. "Designer jeans these days are so stupid. I can't believe you bought those like that." I was more confused than angry, even still, and a line had formed, so I gave him his change and ignored him as I served the next customer. He continued to *stand next to the register* for about 5 minutes, telling the influx of people how stupid I was for buying baggy, unflattering jeans with holes at the knees and pockets. Most didn't care and ignored him, but after one of my favorite regulars shrugged and told him "looks like normal wear and tear to me!" He stomped out to his car and left. That was years ago and I'm still confused.

I saw a guy running on the treadmill while wearing jeans today. I just can't understand why anyone would do that. Is it comfort? Lack of options? Confidence? Please enlighten me. Edit: For those of you that say you do it for convenience (wear the same jeans to class, work, etc afterwards), I just can't imagine anyone wanting to wear the same clothes anywhere after wearing them at the gym. Now, I'm not here to judge the way you do things (and I don't care tbh) but I feel like I should note that the equipment that you're using has other people's sweat, spit, and sometimes blood all over it. So, yeah, maybe you don't sweat in the gym. I guarantee the guy that used the bench before you did though. 
Ok, so I've been desperately searching for a pair of light wash or stonewash jeans that will give me stacks worthy of Yeezus for no more than $200. I have an inseam from crotch to bottom of 32 inches which puts APC jeans out of consideration. Thanks so much to anyone that can help me. 
Just had a conversation with my co-workers today to discover that they spend ~$150 on a pair of jeans. This completely blew my mind. I look for somewhat fashionable, but inexpensive jeans. However my jeans also get holes in them pretty quickly (after ~6 months) to the point where I have to repair them or let them go. What are people's thoughts on the cost vs. durability of jeans? 
it's going to be made in their newest cut on the roster, Lean Dean slim tapered. 100% organic cotton that they've been doing. They're 14.75 oz. Only 10 stores in the U.S. are getting them. I think it's pretty rad "Cotton is organically grown and harvested in Texas, with spinning and weaving taking place at Cone Denim's White Oak Mill in Greensboro, North Carolina. Finally, each of the limited run of 1000 jeans are sewn at the iconic Last Denim Shop in San Francisco. Each pair is numbered 1-1000 and presented in an organic poplin cotton duffel bag. " 
I have several pair of jeans that won't stay zipped. As a male that goes commando I felt it was an issue I needed to solve, so here is the solution I found. 
Hello again reddit! I am the president of the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa, California I did an AMA about [9 months about my experiences, and now I am back to answer more questions. I'm also excited to be participating in the PEANUTS gift exchange through redditgifts and sending one of you something great, and I hope you'll join me by signing up here: Last day to sign up is **this** Sunday October 5! Victoria is assisting me via phone today. **Update**: Well, first of all, I wish you all luck in the reddit gift exchange, because I think that's pretty exciting! And I always want to say: I hope people can come to the Museum in Santa Rosa, Ca, and if you can't do that, at least you can get on the Schulz Museum Website because we are putting gore and more on the website that delves into the history of Sparky's life and a lot of the memorabilia we have is slowly getting on the website, so visit us in both places, but better than anything, come to the museum and skate at the ice arena next door and see where Sparky lived! It's Thank you! 
OK, I work behind the bar in a popular bar in Brighton, Normally I wear jeans when working but as the weather has been quite warm I opted to wear a long thin cotton skirt but unless I wore a G-string I had quite a visible panty line so I opted to go commando. The manager went down into the cellar to carry out a stock check, access to the cellar is through a trapdoor behind the bar and I carried on behind the bar. You get used to working around the open trap door and after an hour or so I had more or less forgotten that the manager was down there. I had been stood taking to a customer for a minute or 2 when I heard a discreet cough from below where I was standing. It was only then that I realised I had been stood astride the open trapdoor on full display to my boss. His face spoke volumes as I looked down to see him grinning up at me with one hand theatrically draped over his eyes saying "Am I clear to come up now that the rainforest has been cleared?" The only saving grace was that he had left his i-phone by the till and did not have it with him or I suspect I would now be a lot more famous than I ever want to be. **edit** 1) I get it, euphemistic references to trapdoors are now unoriginal. 2) If you are desperate for nudes send me money and I will send you someone else's nudes and we can both be happy. 3) Thank you for the insulting PMs and comments, I will be sure to devote the attention they deserve, the better ones I may borrow for personal use when required (I am a British barmaid and have to deal with pissed chavs frequently).

My name is Cory Brandan. I am the vocalist for the band Norma Jean. We have 6 records including our newest record WRONGDOERS. Besides music, I also love visual art and graphic design and have done many projects with that, including the layout for Wrongdoers. Something a lot of people may not know about me is that I was actually a guitarist first and Norma Jean is the first band I've ever been in where I didn't play guitar and sing at the same time, but over the years I have really embraced the mic, my voice as an instrument and I love what I do more than ever. I love the South, my family and the Lord. Loud, proud and stubborn as hell! Happening now: I am at my home in Arkansas and have been cooking a pork shoulder for 11 hours. All the guys are flying in today and we will begin rehearsing for a set of intimate small venue shows in a few select cities to prepare new songs from the new record. It's going to be a lot of fun! Dates posted at I'll be answering questions from 2pm to 3:30 EST or so. It's really me ----&gt; ****** Thanks for all the questions everyone. I wish I could stay and keep answering. This has been a lot of fun. I'll try to do another one some time. Be sure to check out the newest record Wrongdoers and check out our tour dates at 6:30pm EST - Going to try and answer a few more of these right now. 
Like Jean Reno in Leon. 
What I've observed is that women tend to wash them quite often as opposed to men who tend to leave it for as long as possible. Personally I try to drag it out, spot cleaning them when I can. I think jeans ruin with washing as they fade pretty quickly depending on the type of denim. 8 months is average for me. What about you guys? EDIT: Whoah, lots of attention! Also it seems that I've forgotten to mention that I'm a 20 y.o. [M]ale. It seems like many people didn't know about avoiding wash to preserve denim? It screws up the fade and stretch of your jean, so unless you want the fade, I would try to spot clean stains where possible - especially if it is dry denim, which fades like crazy... TL;DR - Never wash your jeans if it can be avoided - unless they're cheap and you dgaf. 
"Get on your knees," he said bluntly, his heavy hand pushing down on my shoulder. Surprised by his strength I lost my balance and collapsed on the floor, yelping quietly when the rough wooden tiles bruised my kneecaps. His right hand gripped my short ponytail while he was unzipping his jeans. The worst part wasn't his plump, meaty shaft, clearly oversized for my mouth. It wasn't even his bushy crotch that scratched my lips every time he thrust my head forward. It was feeling his dick slowly inflate inside me after each push, reaching further and further in as his erection bloomed. I was gagging and struggling to breathe but he didn't care. He just pounded away, painfully stretching my throat until I was teary-eyed and red in the face. He didn't come. He just stopped abruptly and tossed my head aside like used paper. I took the moment to wipe the drool off my agape mouth with a hand; my tongue had gone numb. "Your mouth is big on excuses, not so much on action," he grunted in his thick Pakistani accent. "For your sake I hope your pussy is better." And before I could process his words, he forced me on the ground and slid my sweatpants down my thighs. I paid him the rent money on the 20th, like I had promised. I paid him again ten days later, even though that meant starving for a week. He said nothing. By the end of the month I was ready to leave town. That's when the pregnancy test came positive. 
His jeans were still tight. We were at lunch and he said, "you know what these jeans and a small hotel have in common? No ball room." I'm 33 with my first son on the way and my dad can still get me. 
Tonight my girlfriend broke up with me while I was sitting in an internet cafe playing some games with some friends. I get a text from her and I’m pretty happy. It’s been long distance the past two months and she hasn’t been great at replying to messages. So I was chuffed until I read the message. Needless to say the news was not good and I bailed on my friends cause “i was suddenly feeling unwell” By the time I hit the stairs to leave the cafe I can feel that I’m gonna start crying if I stop moving. Me? Cry in public? A 23 year old man who already struggles with the idea of being masculine. A man (boy lets be honest) Who kept growing a beard because one person one time said it made him look a little older. Fuck that! I will uphold some sort of manliness during this disaster, potentially...hopefully. Against all the odds I make it to the bus stop without crying. But the bus isn’t coming for ages. I'm pacing up and down checking and re checking my phone. Re reading the msg getting depressed all over again. The bus shows up and I’m on board in a second. But I don’t sit down I'm fucking stalking the aisle back and fourth. Keep moving. Keep fucking moving. I’m fucking daring the bus driver to tell me to sit down. He does so “Oi mate you can you sit down?” You want me to sit down? YOU WANT ME TO FUCKING SIT DOWN?! I say in my head. In the real word I’m already sitting. I don’t want to piss off the bus driver. He didn’t break up with me. Keep moving. I’m jiving in my seat, legs fucking jack hammers pounding the floor. Trying to speed up the bus Fred Flintstone style. I know exactly what I’m gonna do when I get home. Change into shorts, chuck my running shoes on and sprint down to the harbour and scream out over the water. Oh yeah just like a fucking movie. Scream at the ocean, like the actor you tell yourself you will eventually be. (HAHAHAH why the fuck am I not proactive enough to audition for anything) Shut the fuck up self destructive nature! We telling a story! Back on track! Bus is about to reach my stop but I’m up already. Everyone else on the bus looks pretty fucking happy I’m going. Oh I’m sorry I wasn’t the ideal co passenger you snobs. I’m dealing with some shit so you’ll have to forgive me! Fly out the door in an instant and Im running up the hill to my house. Punch the back gate with my face. Fucking shit! ( gate just got replaced, way harder to open, opened it into my face) Brush it off! I’m fine (physically I’m fine, emotionally I’m a mess, duh) Back door code gets punched in at lighting speed. I’m up the stairs. Jeans off. Runners on. god dammit man put ya shorts on first then your runners. Runners off. shorts on. Runners on again. Nailed it. I’m down the stairs, grab a quick mouthful of water, reach the back door and it fucking hits me. I need to shit. Like really need to shit. I pause at the door think about risking it. I do not risk it. As I’m running back up stairs to the bathroom I nearly shit myself on the 4th step. I was right not to risk it. Bathroom door flies open, I fly onto the seat and thankfully don’t shit on myself. But I’m not moving. I can’t move much at all. I’m stuck until the shitting ends and I know I won’t make it. I start crying. Like really fucking crying. I have never cried like this before. All the while this torrent of tears was coupled with what I can only describe as some of the most explosive shitting I have ever produced. Probably would have been one of the funniest things I’ve ever done and If I wasn’t sobbing like the world was ending I probably would of laughed. But there I was for 10 minutes shitting an avalanche and crying a downpour. But as all things do, it ended (Much like my relationship! Oh snap! too soon? Of course it’s too soon you’re an emotional wreck. Only through laughter can I grow, HAHAHA, my heart is a black abyss...) I wipe. Pants up. Tears dried. I rush back downstairs grab my earphones chuck on some heavy metal (so fucking hardcore) and start sprinting towards the ocean. It should be noted that this run to the ocean would be achievable by a fit person. I am not a fit person. Even a fit person would struggle to sprint the whole way and yet sprint I did until I felt like my lungs were gonna fucking kill me. Grief it seems does not increase your overall stamina. By the time I make it to the water I am almost more of a physical wreck than an emotional one. But I will persevere! I will scream my anguish out over the water like some crazy method actor. I drag myself up to the edge of the harbor and open my mouth to scream. Only I don’t scream. I instead proceed to projectile vomit into the fucking harbor. It’s acidic, it burns, it kickstarts the tears again and it just keeps going! Are you fucking kidding me body? It was one tiny sprint. I vomit up the past months food. I’m shivering at this stage. Cause it’s winter. It’s 11:52pm and I’m in shorts next to the ocean. (Y em i so smart?) I drag myself to a bench and just sit there staring at the water until my throat stops burning. Then I just walk home. Stepped in dog shit on the way back, because you know, have to keep the misery as high as possible. And now I’m here sobbing silently onto my keyboard. TLDR: Girlfriend broke up with me via text. Tried to dramatically deal with the sadness by planning to run to the ocean and scream out at the water. Ended up Sobbing and shitting at the same time on the toilet for ten minutes. Then tried to run to the ocean but I wasn’t fit enough and I projectile vomited into the ocean when I got there. Numerous other bad things also happened read above. Edit: thank you all for the gold! I've never really posted before and usually I'm very precious about my writing. Thank you all for the support! I have work most of the day but I'll try to write back to some of the comments when I get home. Thanks all.

Looking for brand, color, age, etc. I'm on the market for some new jeans, and I'd like to keep it relatively inexpensive. It's been a while, and I'm looking for some options to keep it versatile. Brands to look for, suggestions on where to buy (for best pricing etc) are helpful! 
The time has come and a crouch blow-out is inevitable on my 508's. I need new jeans, but I'm really not feeling the EU pricing for Levis. So to gain some inspiration, what jeans are you wearing?

I know women's jean sizing is crazy, but I've never been a size 10. I remember in 7th/8th grade being a 14 at NY&amp;C. In college, I was a size 24 at Torrid. I was shopping at target with a friend, and my jeans have gotten pretty baggy. I was a 14, so I grabbed a 12 and a 10 for a laugh - and the 10 fit better than the 12! I'm down to 171lbs (starting weight 315lbs), and my goal is a mere 22lbs away. Also, on my way there, I'll half my weight. That's an exciting goal. 
I'm just wondering because I was in high school in the late 90's early 2000's when baggy jeans were at its peak. Wearing a pair of skinny jeans or even standard Levi's 501's would result in endless teasing and jokes. Tight pants/jeans were always the easiest target to go after when joking someone. Now I see high school kids wearing the slimmest/skinniest fit possible. I always think if I wore those same jeans in 2001 I'd probably be sent home crying due to teasing/bullying. 
Ok, so I've been desperately searching for a pair of light wash or stonewash jeans that will give me stacks worthy of Yeezus for no more than $200. I have an inseam from crotch to bottom of 32 inches which puts APC jeans out of consideration (PS and PNS have a 33.5 inseam). Thanks so much to anyone that can help me. 
Backstory: I ordered a pair of 38x34 slim fit jeans 4 months ago, and when they arrived, I couldn't even get them past the middle of my thighs. Instead of returning them, I vowed that I would one day fit into those jeans. They weren't even particularly nice jeans either. I was just so pissed that they didn't fit. Today, decided that I would try them on to gauge my progress. I expected them to still not fit, as I couldn't even zip up the fly a month before. I put them on, and was able to button them, zip it up, and even had space in the waist. I even had room in the thighs. They fit so incredibly well. My scale showed me losing weight, but I never really saw the physical changes. Seeing and feeling the jeans fit like that made me realize how much my body has changed these past few months, and has motivated me to keep on going.

Im 35, 170 lbs, 6'2. I've been trying to improve my fashion and bought [these 32 32 Levis thinking slim is the way to go. They fit close, closer than Im used to, but I think I could get used to them. My concern is that they seem either too tight or too try-hard given my age? Comments and opinions appreciated by a faltering mfa novice. edit: thanks for the positive reviews on the jean's fit. I will be keeping them. edit 2: Just want to say thanks again to you guys. I really appreciate all the comments and generally positive atmosphere. I wore the jeans again today at work and they are feeling much more comfortable and am no longer self conscious of them. Also one minor error on my part- the jeans are 32-34s, not 32-32. My mistake. 
Sveiki! I am going to be traveling the Baltic states this summer, mostly Lithuania though, and I found a couple of websites with tourist information and national parks etc. but it would be neat if you guys could chime in with some of your own personal favourite things to do, too. We're interested in pretty much everything. Lithuanian history (castles - Trakai obviously -, museums, churches, architecture in general), art, and especially nature and sports (mountain biking, hockey, surfing, parkour, these sorts of things). Also, operas, concerts, and open air music festivals. Classical music, rock, blues, EDM, Reggae doesn't really matter as long as it's fun and the people are chill. I know that is pretty vague but just feel free to write anything you remotely like about your country or something you are looking forward this summer and we will be sure to check it out. Or, here are some more detailed questions, * 1 What is your own personal favourite beach in Lithuania? * 2 Is there a hockey arena/rink that is open during the summer? * 3 What is the highest point (or alternatively, the point with the most scenic view in your country)? Most scenic hike, etc. * 4 What is the largest *pine(!)* forest in your country? * 5 How expensive is Lithuania compared to western Europe? (Clothes, mostly. Sneakers, jeans, jackets, coats, etc. Also, sports (hockey) gear.) * 6 What are some cool and thoughtful and original souvenirs to bring back? (Maybe a traditional piece of clothing, or just whatever?) * 7 What is the best shopping mall/street in Vilnius (or anywhere else)? * 8 How easy is it to cross into Kaliningrad and Belarus? Can you get like a 24h-visa at the border or do you have to apply in advance? * 9 What is the best way to travel in Lithuania (and Latvia)? Is there something like a "Baltic-rail" train ticket or a "Lithuania-ticket" that you pay once and travel as much as you want? How is public transportation? (We are 99% sure we want to rent a car but if traveling by train/bus is really really cheap and convenient we might do that instead.) * 10 Is there something like a "museum village" about how Lithuanians used to live in the 18th century and before that? (That is worth visiting?) If you can just answer one or a few of these questions or just recommend anything I might not have thought of that would be very nice. =) Your own personal opinions are very much appreciated. Aciu! 
I know this is an unpopular rant, but I'm kind of annoyed. I'm really small, and barely fit into size 23 jeans, which a lot of jeans companies don't even make. I fit into a size TEN for girls, but I hate wearing kids clothing because I already feel unwomanly a lot of the time and the idea of wearing kids clothes makes it worse. So today after a few hours in a mall trying to find any jeans I went into a department store and asked the first salesperson I saw (a guy) if they had any brands of jeans that had 23s or ran small. A saleslady (a little on the larger side) came up and said sarcastically "oh, go away from us" and told me there were kids jeans downstairs. I get it, there are some larger women that want to be my size. But I have so much trouble finding clothing that fits me and makes me feel like a woman and not a child and making me feel even worse after an afternoon of failure is not the way to make a sale. It's also just a shitty thing to do in general. I left the store without making a purchase and now I still need jeans. Where do you thinner ladies get jeans? I need a belt with my Uniqlo 23s. Even high fashion jeans usually only go down to 24. edit: Thanks so much for the support ladies! I am kind of glad I'm not the only one to deal with this but also kind of sad that everyone has to deal with this sometimes. I've got a list of places to try shopping next weekend so hopefully I'll having some rocking new jeans soon! 
My friend and I recently got back into playing Dayz SA. (he just got it and i haven't played in at least 6 months). I was wondering were would the best place to find military clothing is, because i have shit tons of loot and a pimped out akm but still wearing my dirty new spawn jeans. 
Damn that piece of denim that makes it look like you have a boner everytime you sit down wearing jeans.

I had to quit lithium cold turkey after having signs of toxicity a few months ago. Since then I've gained at least 10 lbs and feel like every day I'm bigger than I was the day before -- and it's not all in my head, because the jeans I bought a couple months ago, that fit well, with just a bit of extra room in the waist, barely fit. Anyone else have this experience? I was hoping I'd be able to start losing some of the weight I'd gained on lithium(which I'd already lost a bit of by excersizing more), but now it's piling on even faster, despite eating/exercising about the same.

The lube comes out and Tommy s cock goes ininto Sam s super tight asshole. Vinnie spent some time under house arrest but he made the best of it. He tries on a couple of pairs of underwear for us, before we call Dan in with the baby oil. So they went out for a hike and when they found a place that was semi secluded they got completely naked and went to town on each other. These two swap some spit, making out as they rub their cocks together, Troy sucks on Alex s nipples, they pump their own dicks until finally we get to the cock sucking as Troy shoves Alex s meat down his throat and takes his balls in his mouth. And it doesn t look like hot, muscular Sam minds either, cause once Tommy s on his knees sucking on Sam s knob, it doesn t matter what he looks like. The sight of Ethan s juicy ass makes AJ crave some cock and he pushes Ethan onto the bed and chokes on his dick, making it grow before they switch places and Ethan gets a turn to gnaw on AJ s man meat. Our expert pair of hands brings him to orgasm and we have a very satisfied Alfie laying on our bed. We love ass, and these boys have some of the finest ass we ve seen. Tommy makes Sam s cock grow as he works it over, but Sam s hungry for some meat, too, and he kisses his way down to Tommy s waiting dick and gives it some TLC before these two guys take things to the next level. His chest is smooth, but has fuzz around his cock and also lets us see the fuzz around his hole when he pulls his legs back. His rock hard uncut cock is pushing at the thick fabric of his blue jeans and begging to be free so he reaches in and grabs a satisfying handful of his own throbbing desire. But that image of Ethan s delicious ass is burned into AJ s mind and it s clear he won t be completely satisfied until he claims that ass as his own. Simon is a young straight lad born in Lithuania, who has lived the bulk of his life in London. I couldn t leave but my girlfriend came over every day so all I did was fuck and watch TV for 3 months. AJ takes charge once more as he dictates the next position, that domineering and demanding personality is sexy as fuck and submissive little Ethan agrees, shooting his load all over with AJ close behind. Even when soft, Chester s cock is enormous, so we can t wait to see him tugging at it and making it shoot he plays with his balls and long uncut shaft pleasuring himself another straight guy who really doesn t mind being watched. Hes been reticent about allowing us to do a massage shoot, which made us even keener to get a pair of man s hands on him. After the necessary oil, he gets both his front and back massaged and lets us venture over his legs and pert bum, and then on to his cock. He looks good on camera, especially like today when he starts by stripping off for a shower, looks like he just needs someone to scrub his back. It s been quite awhile since Troy and Alex have gotten laid, so these boys have some pent up energy they need to d what better way to release that energy than by getting a little naughty with each other. They exchange some very heated kisses in between and we get a nice view of their smooth, perfect bodies tangled together. Alex is craving some cock and deepthroats Troy s massive member, going balls deep before Troy takes his cock out of Alex s hot mouth and puts it in his tight ass. Grinning as he looks down at the camera with complete confidence and control. From his dreamy eyes and angelic face to his smooth fit body and perfect uncut cock this hot little French Canadian is living proof. And a very nice cock it is too with only a little play it is solid for us, and he gets both his long uncut shaft wanked and his balls stroked at the same time. When he couldn t take it anymore and was about to shoot, Levi told Chris that now is his turn to get fucked so he bent him over and was more than happy to return the favor. When Chester cums onto his lean muscular body he makes sure he pulls every last drop out of his schlong before jumping in the shower. As we see in this photo shoot, he is more than adequately endowed. Chester is a very sporty, lean guy he has a natural athletic look, and has a thing for tattoos he shows us his body art as he strips off, and has a cheeky grin most of the time he is stripping. Some of the oil drips down on to Marcus s very thick uncut cock, which quickly gets solid. For their scene, they decided that they wanted to explore the path less traveled literally. He slides a tentative finger inside his asshole and slowly slides it in and out as his cock lurches to attention in his hand. Sam s moans will tell you just how much he s loving Tommy s big dick up his hole, so much so that he busts a nut while he s straddling Tommy, dripping his hot cum onto Tommy s balls as he finishes. He doesn t wait for permission before he fills Ethan s tight little asshole full of his rock hard dick and pounds him hard, making Ethan s ass cheeks bounce as he pumps him hard and smacks that ass again and again. Chris found Levi s weak spot with his finger and he wasn t going to stop playing with it until Levi was begging to be fucked senseless. He opens his fly and pulls out 9 beautiful inches of uncut Italian cock. Max grabs a seat in our famous orange chair and starts pawing at his pants. Marcus has a great physique his body is muscular, with great definition. Begging for approval but confident in his own ability to get himself off. Chester is a extremely confident lad and with good reason, he s hiding a monster in his underpants. A delicious cumshot to finish off one hot encounter. He pulls his beautiful uncut cock out of his drawers and holds it up for the camera s approval as he looks down with his puppy dog eyes. Sam bottoms for Tommy in a new position, straddling him as Tommy fucks him hard and they make out. It goes without saying that they both shot massive loads. He grabs a seat on the couch and starts pawing at his cock as it pitches a tent inside his blue jeans. Pulling up his legs to reveal his virgin straight asshole then dumping a thick load of cum all over his tight twink belly. We all know that the sounds Levi makes when he has something up his butt are quite arousing but this time they were something else. Ethan s ass gets red from the spankings as AJ fucks him, but he s a power bottom and he s willing to take a little abuse in return for a whole lot of pleasure. 
So I'm a college student and I was wondering how many days in a row you think its socially acceptable to wear the same pair of jeans? I have a lot of pairs of jeans but one favorite pair and a pair of chinos that I alternate between. 
Sit back, read and enjoy my misfortune. Today was my 25th birthday, my friends invited me over to hang out. I get all dressed up to head over to my friends place. As I get there, I need to pee. I hadn't been feeling well for the last couple of days so as I am peeing, I need to fart... So I do... but its not. Liquid poop, my jeans immediately are soaked and I reach back to check and raise my wet, poopy hand to my face to smell... yes, it is in fact poop... Like a small part of me had hoped it would be water off a bush or something else. I panic, 25 years old and up until today could say, "I have never actually shit myself." well not anymore. I do what anyone would do and drive home in shame, well little did I know that all my friends were inside ready to surprise me as I came inside the door at their house. I literally drove away from my surprise party. For some reason, I had a bathrobe in my car so I wrapped myself in that (my jeans were drenched) and climbed into my car. As I am driving home, next thing I see red and blue lights... "Are you fucking kidding me...", I pull over. Cop approaches window, leans in and immediately reels back. "What the fuck is that smell?" Now I'll be honest... as a 25 year old man, I started crying. Me "I'M... sob... I'm... sob... SO SORRY BUT... officer, I uh... sob shit myself." Cop "You what..?" Me "I pooped myself, man..." Cop "You are serious?" Me "Yes sir." Cop "How old are you sir?" Me "I'm 25... its my birthday and I pooped myself." Cop "Um... hold on a minute here, I'll try get you on your way." Cop disappears for a few minutes, I assume getting the last laugh out as he tells his buddies then comes back Cop "Alright sir, you have a good night." Me "Uh... sob I'll try, sir." Cop "Well shit son, not like it can get any worse... Sometimes, shit happens." TLDR - Went to pee before a surprise party, tried to fart and shit my pants. Drove home and got pulled over by a cop, made fun of my shitty situation. 0/10 would not recommend EDIT - Holy fuck, did not expect this to blow up. Few things. 1. Went to friends house (where surprise party was) 2. Went to pee in bushes near house before going inside 3. Went to fart, shit myself 4. Left house (where they were waiting) and drove home. 5. Got pulled over, made fun of by cop 6. Got home, found out next day I missed my party. Sad. And to whoever gave me gold, What the fuck? Donate to some charity or something next time not some dude with too much trust in his butthole. Also 7. I had "Herb" in the car as well, forgot to mention. Contributed to my "Oh, fuck I'm going to jail covered in shit." crying. 8. I apologize for the layout and writing of the story, I am bad and should feel bad. 
Hello reddit. I am [Ben I am the founder of the [Zachor Holocaust Remembrance I was born in Krakow, Poland, in 1928. With the exception of my older sister Lola and myself, the rest of my family was killed by the Nazis. Over the 5 years of the war, I was fortunate to survive several ghettos, as well as the notorious camps of Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and finally be liberated in Dachau. After the war, in 1947 I immigrated to the United States where a few years later, in 1950, I met and married my wife Jean. Over the years, I became a successful realtor in Los Angeles and after retiring in 1995, I have devoted my time to being a volunteer to speak in colleges and schools about the Holocaust. I wrote a book about my experiences, entitled [Living a Life that I am looking forward to answering your questions today. Victoria from reddit will be helping me via phone. Anything I can do to further the cause of tolerance - I am always ready, willing and able to do. Anyway, you go ahead and ask any questions. Proof: **Edit**: Well, there are several things I would like to say. One of them is: read my book. It's very important. Not just because I want to sell a book. It's important that I made sure, on eBook, you can buy it for $3, so no child can say they cannot afford this book. And besides my book, I lately started an audiobook, which any person who doesn't have the time or can't read it for whatever reason, they can listen to me, they can listen to *my voice,* and *my story.* And it's very inspiring. Because I show them how things can... be done! And I tell them in my audiobook, what you can do, to succeed in life. What it means, living a life that matters. But besides the fact that I wrote a book, besides the fact that I am speaking, I started the Zachor Holocaust Remembrance Foundation for one thing and one thing only - to keep this world from acquiring amnesia, forgetting. *Zachor* means remember. And I want to get across this to all the listeners and readers. I want you to remember. Because when I am gone, who will be left to continue to teach about the Holocaust? Who will be left, to counteract the Holocaust deniers? So it is so important that the Zachor Foundation will live on forever. But more importantly, I wanted to find a way that can make YOU, the listeners, the readers, the visitors, I want to enable YOU to do something to keep this world - to make it a **better world**. **What can YOU do to change things?** And that's when I started a new website, called This is something we can do. Let our voices be heard. You and I shouting out, our voices may not be heard, but if MILLIONS shout out, we can be heard. This is a worthy cause, this is a worthy idea. If millions shout out against bullying, against hatred, against Anti-Semitism - Victoria, those shout-outs will be on our website *forever.* It's a wall. With shout-outs. Can you imagine your great-great-grandchildren punching in your name, and your shout-out will come up? Your name, your date, your age, and what your shout-out was? How important is that? That's something everyone can do. We are hoping to get 6 million shout-outs to compensate for the 6 million silenced voices. I feel obligated, as a survivor, to do that. To speak for my family who were killed, slaughtered. But there is something *you* can do too, to help. Shout-out in this world. Let everyone know what you believe in. And it doesn't have to stop at 6 million. We could go global, eventually. Imagine what the impression that this would have on the world, if millions of us shout-out. And by the way, the kids in school love the idea. Because they take this shoutout, and they see it themselves on the website, standing for what they believe in, against bullying or racism, and then they go home, and tell their parents, and now the parents feel ashamed and of course they do it too... So it's important to keep this world from acquiring amnesia, and to -- you know, Victoria, I feel so strong about this, that there is so much hatred in this world, and nobody is turning the other course. *Who is going to reverse the hatred? Who is going to stop it from happening?* So we started this foundation, for a purpose. To reverse the trend of hatred into tolerance. Love. Instead of hating. This is something I want to urge every listener, every reader. **Please.** Do that. We are willing to take care of it, whatever needs to be done, but I want to see the shout-outs. And remember one thing: these kids, who shout-out, we never know who they will grow up to be. Some of these kids may be people of importance, even a President. So remember - this will always be there to remind them - you made a pledge, a shout-out, for tolerance, against racism, whatever you chose. This is so important. I urge all of you to do it. Victoria, you can help, by doing exactly what you're doing, recording it. Thank you. 
My work attire is very casual and i wear jeans 80% of the time.. I just want some minimalistic shoes to wear with my slim jeans.. What are your favorites? Post pictures being worn with jeans if possible. Thanks guys. 
You know, in most jeans and such, there's the extra pocket in the right pocket... what's it for, or what do you use it for? 
Earlier today I saw two kids who had just broken into someone's car near my house. On my bike I accidentally followed them for a block and realized what was going on and circled back to find them. By then they had ditched the bags in an alley. I waited for the cops since there was some woman's stuff strewn all over in an alley, including her work ID. When the officer showed up they asked about a description. The kids had taken off their shirts so as to make it harder to find them if they put them on later. She said, "this is the thing that always gets them, did you see their shoes?" I totally missed them, but two kids in dark jeans holding white shirts in their hands isn't too much to go on - but it's not like they were going to bring an extra pair of shoes. Anyway, it's a TIL, but YSK to keep an eye out for shoes as well. Edit: Yes, look out for their shoes *in addition to* the rest of their clothes, not *just* shoes. Thanks to u/ilikemazdas for clarifying. 
LOSEIT I CAN'T EVEN HANDLE MYSELF RIGHT NOW. I started my quest to weight loss when I stuffed myself into what were supposed to be my mom/bloaty jeans-- they are stretchy and super high waisted for goodness sakes. I could BARELY get them on. Welp, I cried. Flash forward to now, and I'm currently in my TIGHTEST skinny jeans and there isn't a lovehandle in sight. BOOYAH I had to tell someone :P 
Hi reddit! We study the evolution of intelligence by conducting experiments in computational simulations of evolution. Our work not only sheds light on the evolution of intelligence in natural animals, but will also accelerate attempts to create artificial intelligence (AI). Individually, we are: · Kai Olav Ellefsen, who recently received a Ph.D. from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and is currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Brazilian Institute of Robotics · Jean-Baptiste Mouret, who is an associate scientist at Inria (France), and previously was an assistant professor at Pierre &amp; Marie Curie University (France), and · Jeff Clune, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Wyoming, who directs the [Evolving Artificial Intelligence laboratory] Our [recent PLOS Computational Biology suggests that when computational brain models called neural networks are organized into modules they are better at learning new information without forgetting old knowledge. The brains of animals (including humans) are modular, which means they have many separate units, such as those for language and facial recognition. While natural animals tend to forget gradually, artificial neural networks currently exhibit what is called 'catastrophic forgetting’, meaning they rapidly overwrite previously acquired knowledge when learning a new skill. We found that modularity significantly reduced such catastrophic forgetting in these computer brains. For summaries of the work, please watch our [summary read [a story about the work in the Atlantic] or [listen to a BBC interview about the (the section on our work starts at 1:24). **We will be back at 1pm EDT (10 am PDT, 6 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask us anything!**

That's the link to the website, in case you're interested in reading more about what today was all about. I've worked at a rape crisis center for the last year and it's a job that I love, but it can be very taxing. The ignorance I face everyday from the community can also be very taxing. Denim Day is just one of those things that inspires me though. An awful thing happened to this woman, but the reaction from women in POWER to this awful thing, all coming together like that to say "this is wrong", and doing something like wearing jeans to show their support... that makes me feel good about people. Although this happened over a decade ago, it still makes me feel good. 
A couple years ago, I was a manager for a fashionable plus size clothing store. I absolutely loved it. The bad customers were bad (as expected) and sometimes awful (also as expected) but at least they gave me something to laugh about with my co workers. However, the good customers...they were why I worked there. &amp;nbsp; One day, a woman in her mid-40s came in with her husband and three boys. She was wearing a pullover and baggy jeans. She was sweet, but very reserved about trying on clothes. She told me that hadn’t purchased women’s clothing for several years and was hoping I could help her with jeans (one could say that she was *ahem* all about that bass). Regardless of her weight, she was an extremely beautiful and darling woman. Her family was super supportive of helping here regain some of her self esteem. I was pumped to help her out. A process this big was going to take a while, so I urged her family to wait on the supplied benches while she and I got to work. So, we shopped, grabbing some cute tops and fun bras. We talked about how to build wardrobes and mix-and-match pieces, and then we got to the danger zone: jeans. &amp;nbsp; I guessed that she was about a size 18-20 and after discussing different cuts of denim, we settled on higher rise, high stretch skinny jeans: they would accommodate her proportionately small waist and large posterior. &amp;nbsp; We got into the fitting room and I eagerly coaxed her to try on one of the outfits I had picked out for her. A few moments later, she called me over to come into the fitting room. I slipped inside to see her. “I haven’t felt this beautiful for a long time,” she said to me. There were tears in her eyes and a huge grin on her face. &amp;nbsp; I motioned for her husband and kids to come see. As soon as the husband saw her, he choked up. I couldn’t get over the grin on his face. There was so much love in his eyes. “You look absolutely gorgeous, babe.” &amp;nbsp; They ended up getting her almost an entirely new wardrobe. I’ve never seen a happier family.

So, I'm going back to something I tried a while back, though I'm putting my own little twist on it know that I have some more experience. Either way, Zombies, I'll get to the story and further down I'll deal with the exacts of them. ____________________________________________ New Johnville was one of the last standing bastions of humanity, though 2 years after the epidemic, it was now thriving. The end days came through a virus that passed through fluid, and could only be described as the Zombie Disease. It mutated quickly, and frequently, making most vaccines pointless. The disease ravaged the world, leaving humanity in shambles and cut off from each other. People rebuilt quickly though, and now we follow the story of a handful of citizens of New Johnville. The first individual that we're looking to, is a young woman named Rose Akker. Her skin was a fine cinnamon brown that was smooth to the touch, the light padding of fat having formed even with the heavy rationing and carefully prepared meals. One of her most eye grabbing features was her chest…it was a little more than a handful, thanks to the extra weight she had gained, the same could be said about the jiggly rear that rested heavily in her pants. She kept her large green eyes behind a pair of thin rimmed glasses, the emerald orbs peeking around every new room she entered. She wore her ruddy hair in large curls, the length decent, going down to her mid back when she was in town, out on missions, she tied them up into a tight hard bun worn under a hat. Her long powerful legs barely had the coating of weight, the light layer around her thighs hiding the powerful muscles. Like most citizens, she wore hardy available clothes such as jeans or pull on t-shirts, though her prized outfit, the one she wore in any formal occasion was a sundress she had kept since the end. She stood on The Wall, a piling of shipping containers that were augmented with cement and and a moat, carrying with her a Mossberg and a pry bar as her weaponry, waiting for her partner to arrive. They had been chosen to go on a salvage run, more of a scouting at this point, keep eyes on local points of interests and numbers of the dead. She sighed as she checked her watch, wondering if she had arrived early, or come late. The hot sun glared down, and the dampness of the air made it feel to be around mid. spring. _____________________________________________ Alright, with the opening and a little history out of the way, lets talk exacts about the zombies. Knowledge that is known by all: They are dead, with out a pulse. They can only be killed by damage to the cerebellum, destruction of the spine only disables muscle movement linked to or lower than the vertebrae. Mutation is evident in minor degrees, the most severe being that of enhanced strength to the point of destruction to a vault. They don't rely on a single sense, only forsaking a sense when the responsible organ is destroyed. Bites have a 85% probability of infection, reduced to 40% if amputation occurs with in the first hour. Death will take anywhere from 15 minuets to 24 hours, after death zombification happens over 10 minuets. What is Unknown about Zombies: The Disease is a modified hybrid of Rabies with a designed virus. Immunity is based of an antibody developed by those who who have had rabies shots or a transfusion from one that has had them. The infection is only prevalent in the United States, all targets are shot on sight on the borders. Those Immune but bitten become carriers. The infection is capable of spreading through mammals, symptoms only appearing in those with carnivorous tendencies. If cooked, tainted meat is edible(This one is not unknown, just not very well spread) My Rules are pretty simple in the end of it all, just use third person, no bathroom play, and introduce your kinks as you want them introduced. Sorry for the clunky set up, not sure how to use a well designed setting that's introduced in the opening ,I'm sure it will streamline eventually. See you soon Zed-Heads~ 
It's starting to get warm here, but not quite warm enough for summer clothes. My skinny jeans are 95% of my pant options, but I have no idea what to wear on my feet. Every spring, I go about a month of really weird footwear choices because I can't figure out what I'm supposed to wear with them. 
I work in an office environment, and can wear jeans (depending on circumstances) whenever I feel like. If I wear on a random Monday or Wednesday nobody notices, although social pressures would sugest wearing proper business attire is the norm. While 95% of the office wears jeans on Fridays. At the end of it, I own one pair of jeans AG Protégé - Roscoe I wanted to wear jeans today, because in essence it's like a Friday (Wednesday before the long weekend). But I couldn't find them (I might have rushed in taking my dry cleaning in and they could be at the cleaners by accident). I was told I should get more jeans, then I wouldn't be in this problem. I figure that for the amount of hours I wear jeans in the run of a month, 1 pair is suitable. How many pairs of jeans do you own? And, what percentage of your wardrobe is made up be denim?

Hello r/india I am moving to Bangalore from Jalandhar and I am sure I will have trouble finding jeans my size. I am about 207 cm(~6'10 in old currency) which makes clothes shopping hell. I came across only 1 store in Mumbai which caters to my frame. Can anyone suggest a store in Bangalore which caters to tall people? P.S. My exact inseam is 37 inch but 38 works fine too.

Why do people like PK Subban? While watching regular season games my friends and I constantly ask eachother and ourselves this question. Off of the ice, PK seems like a great guy. I have seen his interviews and his commercials and he makes me believe that he is sincere in his personality and is an enjoyable person. His PR game is more than admirable, and his charity work, comedy, and interactions with fans are wonderful. However, on the ice PK seems to be a completely different person. I hope that everyone will bear with me in this wall of text and video link that I have constructed, but all of these interactions have lead me to so intensely dislike a person who, off ice, is clearly a terrific guy. How can someone have such different personalities on ice and off? This is my opinion. Why do people like PK? **PK Subban is notorious for diving** 	This year he has lead the league in embellishment penalties and has been fined $2,000 on February 4th 	[And $3,000 on May 20th for his Third infraction of the 	PK is the first and only player to ever be fined Twice for embellishment.

No other player in the league dives as often or as obviously as PK, and as the seasons pass he seems to only be doing it more often, rather than shy away as would be expected of maturing players. 		 		 [**Slashing Mark 	The slash is intentional no matter how it's looked at. Whether he intended on hitting Stone in an unpadded area is arguable. 	Subban injured the rookie and was, according to NHL rules, rightfully thrown from the game. 	What I'm interested in is Subban's consistent responses to be called for penalties. While Subban may have not realized that he truly injured Stone, there is no denying that he took two hands on his stick and intentionally brought it down with force toward Stone. Subban immediately jumps up and down and screams to the officials that it is not deserving of a penalty, and seems to be absolutely shocked that an official could make such a call. Earlier in the game Subban swung at an airborne puck and brought his stick down onto [Ottawa forward Jean-Gabriel Again, note PK's response. He throws up his arms and contests with the officials as if he cannot even imagine that he could have done something wrong, despite clearly knocking the Ottawa player to the ice. The carelessness of Subban is apparent in the amount of damage he could have done had Pageau not been wearing a visor. The tomahawk of PK's stick would have hit him with a tremendous amount of force to his face. **Dirty Player** [**Patrice The Boston Bruins program "Behind the B" captures a valuable insight into Subban's reasoning. 	Following Bergeron into the corner, PK swings hard at the back or Bergeron's head twice and fortunately misses the forward, only to tackle him to the ice. 	When Bergeron confronts the punching, Subban acts as if he doesn't know what he is talking about, and when he admits making the sucker punch attempt, he claims "I thought you were Marchy" (Brad Marchand) [**Milan 	Here Subban makes a similar play in which he sucker punches Boston's Milan Lucic in the back of the head during play. [**Sean 	Here Subban is involved in a scuffle, but when everything has died down and players of both teams are calm, Subban swings through the officials grasps and punches and unsuspecting, unprotected Couturier. **Kris Kreider** 	There is another video that I cannot seem to find of last years ECF in which Subban winds up and punches Kreider in the chest as he turns around to face him, knocking him violently to the ice. Subban seems to use this tactic as a form of bodychecking, although completely incorrect and unsportsmanlike. 	 **Slewfooting** Slewfooting is arguable one of the most dangerous plays in hockey. These plays generally involve the victim and perpetrator falling to the ice, meaning that the player is not worried about where the puck ends up, as long as he can take down the other player. The victim of a slewfoot is completely helpless to their own landing, and often fall straight onto their backs after being airborne and almost always hit helmet to the ice. 	Subbans recent slewfoot on [Logan [In this , Subban has **Four** different slewfooting incidents. The Kunitz play against the boards seems to be the most frightening. I remember watching that game, and even re-watching it my jaw drops in fear of Kunitz's ankles being broken. It’s a miracle that he was not injured on the play. 	Brandon Dubinsky, Patrik Elias, Chris Kunitz, and James Neal are all very dangerously slewfooted by Subban. 	Subban was fined $2,500 for his slewfoot of Kunitz 	 **Unsportsmanlike Play and refusal to take responsibility** PK Subban throws a puck at an unsuspecting official, hitting him in the face. **Johnny Boychuk** I was lucky enough to attend this game. The boos of the Boston crowd when Subban touched the puck may have been louder than the goal horn. Boychuk is my favorite player as well, so this incident made me especially furious. Subban loses a puck battle, and while Boychuk is on his knee, Subban throws an obvious, deliberate punch to the back of the Defenseman's head. Boychuk immediately responds and engages Subban, he throws up his arms in shock that anyone could feel that way about his polite tap on the Bruins helmet. The usually calm Boychuk grabs Subban, who falls and turtles immedialty upon realizing he cannot escape. I miss you Johnny. Go Isles. **Andrew Ference** Another Bruins incident, Subban leaves his feet and drives his forearm and elbow into David Krejci's head. Andrew Ference immedialty attacks PK, who drops to the ground and covers his head, accepting no responsibility for the dirty hit. Although the forearm/elbow drive may be arguable, the leverage given by leaving his feet is not. Given that a good amount of these incidents are versus the Boston Bruins, who I happen to be a fan of, I am a fan of hockey itself before I am a fan of Boston. The rivalry of Boston and Montreal may be the greatest rivalry in all of sports, and I like to think that the two organizations and fans respect one another, but on the ice the hatred is clear. There must be a hundred chippy players in the NHL. Whether it's Marchand, Lucic, Shaw, Cooke, Subban, Neal, Ribeiro, or Ott, it is hard to find this much video evidence of any one of those players committing such obvious unsportsmanlike and disrespectful acts. Aside from Cooke that is.. PK Subban is a tremendous player. He can score, he can stick handle, he can hit, and he can block shots. He won a Norris trophy. His athletic ability is undeniable. However his on ice antics are a disrespect not only to the others involved but his teammates, his franchise, his fans, and most importantly; the game of hockey itself. This post is not intended to infuriate people, or to begin arguments, but rather to bring to light all of these outrageous acts and hope that more people see PK the way that I do.

All of my jeans have this small pocket within my right-hand pocket. At the moment, my cellphone fits into it perfectly, but I imagine that in today's age of iPhones and other such smartphones, other peoples' phones wouldn't be able to fit in these tiny pockets. Redditors, how do you utilize this tiny pocket within a pants pocket? Edit: I have a Samsung T249, if anyone's curious. I used to hate it since it didn't do anything besides make phone calls and texts. But now that I've got my pocket within a pocket, I don't think I'll ever upgrade, just because my phone fits so perfectly. Also, to whomever suggested pushing the pocket from the bottom up to retrieve items: I used to always pull my cell phone out from the top, but your tip has made me view the world in a new light. THANK YOU! 
Black jeans are cool. Black jeans also seem to have more "rules" than regular indigo jeans. Its said black jeans should be very slim or skinny. Should they? I've heard it said that one should aim for stacking around the knees. Should you? People often get waxed black jeans, one of the benefits being that it encourages these ripples. What are the other benefits of waxed black jeans? Black jeans are less popular as raws and as such have fewer cuts available. Or do they? What are your favorite brand/cut options? An favorite inspiration pics? Just trying to start a discussion because people in WAYWT often wear black jeans, but I don't see much talk about them. 
This thread is for simple style questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we strongly suggest checking the sidebar and the wiki before posting!). Fit checks and "How'd I do" questions are a great use of this thread (although they can also go in the daily Outfit Feedback &amp; Fit Check thread). Other example questions: * Could someone take the chest measurement for a small J.Crew oxford? * Is there a place with full measurements for Naked &amp; Famous jeans? * What slim-fitting green cords do you recommend? * Where do I find a military surplus peacoat online? **Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.** 
Do you even exercise legs? Do you have exercises that tone or reduce the size of your legs to beter slide into your favorite pair of boot cut jeans? Do you buy special long socks to show your massive calves off like a fresh set of fake tits? Do you secretly pray every night that skinny jeans will finally go out of style? Do you.... Well... ...You get the point.

What am I missing here? Is it something particular to or about wearing raw denim? Is it a regional thing? I couldn't imagine even going 2 weeks without washing my jeans, but I'm in Oklahoma where we had almost 3 straight months of temps greater than 100 degrees F (and it's humid) and it's impossible not to sweat. Educate me, MFA. ***Edit: Thank you all for your advice. This has been incredibly informative and helpful. Maybe this should be sticky'd?*** 
Hey guys, I'm a senior in high school and I have recently purchased a pair of boat shoes. I've never had a pair so I was wondering a couple things about them. I've heard to never wear them with socks. I agree with this, I didn't like what they looked like with socks. I've also heard to only wear them with shorts. This is fine with me but I only have 2 pairs of shorts. I've seen some people wear them with jeans and it looked fine to me. Then again, I'm not that fashion savvy. So what do you guys think are jeans okay with boat shoes? 
Last time I went to Osheaga, it took an hour in line to get on the metro after the last shows because of the crazy crowds. This year, I want to walk off Ile St Helene to Montreal. The bridge looks like it connects over to the east/Papineau metro area... I'm just not sure how/where to physically walk onto the bridge from Parc Jean Drapeau. Will it be blocked? Anyone do this before? Thanks pals. 
Since my husband DGAF about fashion, we tend to buy his jeans at [big box store] for $15-$20 usd per pair...they would last a year Then we got $30 jeans from [department store], they lasted a year Do I need to buy the man $60 Levis? He doesn't work in construction or anything, he's a SAHD. I have no idea how his jeans get so beat up, but they do. I balk at the idea of $60 jeans but if i'm buying 6-7 pairs of jeans at $20 a pop annually instead of higher quality that lasts longer... Am i /really/ saving?? 
*It's the middle of the night, and what appears to be the head of a human male peaks over the railing leading to the airlock entrance to the SSV Normandy. Seeing that there is no one around, the man then pulls himself up over the railings, and lands on the metal catwalk without so much as a thud. He then walks towards the airlock. He's wearing dark blue jeans, a tee-shirt, and is carrying a black backpack that looks to be jam-packed with all kinds of things. He looks at the airlock, raises his hand, and slowly runs his open hand over the words "SSV Normandy" on the outside of the ship. A tear runs down his cheek, and falls to the cold steel below. He looks down to see the small puddle the tear left, and raises his hand to his face, clearing his right eye with his index finger, and his left eye with a swipe of his thumb. He then forms his hand into a fist, and slams it against the metal hull that is the entrance to the Normandy three times.* **BOOM BOOM BOOM**

I see a lot of jeans for around or above £80/$130 so I was wondering which are actually worth the prices you pay. I know might not be a high price tag to some but for me as a student it is. So for a good quality pair of jeans, what brands would you recommend? 
## After breaking up with Nick Jonas in 2007, Miley Cyrus died her hair black after getting highlights for her ex. Miley Cyrus: &amp;apos;Sex Is A Beautiful And Magical Thing&amp;apos; May 21, 2012 Miley Cyrus has received a lot of flak over the past few years for doing exactly what she&amp;apos;s supposed to - grow up.

Not to mention, science and logic EASILY prove Mohammed was a fraud ergo, Islam is not very tolerant of REAL science last i heard in the middle east men were for pleasure and women for babiesso in conclusion your all gay, thats why yall hate us so much. All men lie and say its 10, 11 12 inches. You praise Allah and you look like one of them. If the medium size is 8 inches wide, your Women must have Elephant Vaginas. Hahaha muslim science haha fags muslims are shit go die you fucking small terroist cocks get a life you dumb islamic belivers nobody likes you guys. You Westerners who are starting a bitching session over this probably do have little penises. That only leaves less than 20 percent of their small population fit for milita.

The 21 year old actor and model has reportedly fell for Miley s wild side and is enjoying their animalistic sex life. Think about it its not 8 inches in diameter wide but 8 inches around use a string then place that next to a ruler, or just use a tailors measure tape and all these people on here are way too uneducated lol wtf has happened to the world and all. It seems we have a decisive edge in the war of the wombs. It certainly looks as though this is the Miley Cyrus sex tape video weve all been waiting for, and though the manhood being serviced is tiny by Islamic standards, there is little doubt that it belongs to a Muslim man. Nobody cares about the Islamic shit its just science and plus Arabians and Asians always will have small cocks. 8 inches : It is true and confirmed by islamic science, as the medium size for muslim cock is 8 inches wide. They just met up and spent a few hours going at it. Hahahahahababab if you had an 8 ince wide penis then youd be a genuine frak of nature since 8 inches is the adverage LEINGTH of all human penises, and the world record for gerth is 6.5 so your a liar. A source shared: Miley has mentioned that their sex life has consisted of filming and taking pictures but they are instantly erasing it after watching and looking at it.

Another source added previously: It s very animalistic and wild between them. One suspects that this sex tape video will be just one of many to come from Miley Cyrus.

It appears as though Miley Cyrus finally has had a sex tape leaked to the web. As you can see in the video below, a woman who bares a remarkable resemblance to Miley Cyrus expertly sucks off a man.

I cannot express how happy I am nor how good I feel. I will share [this album of before and though! I started being serious about weight loss late last winter, around Feb/March 2013, by cutting back on the main reason for my gain (nighttime TV snacking.) I was at around 185 lbs at 5'4". Then I began using MFP in the summer and went to spin classes in the fall. Thanksgiving (US version) came along and I stopped the gym and MFP. I was still watching what I was eating, sort of, but not really doing much. I've been back at it the past month and a half since my husband is now on board to lose with me (we got fitbits too!) and I am so happy that I was able to finally get into a pair of size 10 jeans! I am still 7 pounds from goal and I have a lot of firming up to do, but I feel great and I wanted to share with this awesome community. You are all so encouraging and supportive, I wanted to share my success to hopefully inspire somebody else. If I can do it, anyone can! 
Seems like the XX-012's have started arriving (just got mine from my school post office) Discuss and post fit pics of the jeans and fit here! 
This is a throw away account so i dont get sued for telling the truth. I work in the industry born and raised in Dallas TX where suicide bunny is Based and know Pip/scott personally. if she finds out about this they WILL come after me but i dont give a fuck anymore this shit has gone way too far. I really hate to be that guy but i cannot give up myself or any of my sources as one of them has signed a non disclosure contract but when you piece it all together you will know i am right because it all makes sense. Ive been debating on making this post for a long time now. I had my suspicions for years and now have legit sources to confirm each and every one of them. I figured people would figure it all out eventually but only the Dallas TX vape scene is up on most of this. Everyone in dallas hates SB and it is certainly NOT because of their success. Shes giving every Texas Juice maker a bad name and i cant take it anymore. There is A LOT to cover here so i must apologize in advance for the Novel youre about to read but this is VERY important for the community to know what is really going on behind the scenes. I run a prominent Shop+Liquid company in Dallas TX where suicide bunny/wolf pack is based and know several people who work for her. They are all tired of lying for her. Employees were TOLD TO LIE TO EVERYONE at vape summit last year and tell everyone their products are mixed/packaged in the five pawns lab (they do this for a substantial fee) in los angeles and that is most definetely NOT the case. A friend of mine.. lets go ahead and call him (friend #1) interviewed to manage ALL liquid production at wolf pack (SB distributor/parent company) which includes Vape Wild Ejuice, Wolfpack Ejuice, SB/kings crown And of course Cloud Company. He was supposed to manage product production/steeping and keep mistakes below 4% ( which doesn't really matter because they ship them all out for sale either way) so basically they wanted him to run 5 companies products for 32k per year. He made it all the way up the interview chain to pip and scott before salary was mentioned &amp; they low balled him by about ~68k per year so he walked. Friend #1 was absolutely appauled at what he saw when touring their NEW warehouse in plano TX just 2 weeks ago. THERE IS NO CLEAN ROOM.. AT ALL.. WHATSOEVER.... Seriously. I have heard before that their ""production facility"" was nasty from another friend in the industry about a year ago but shrugged it off because I figured that was during the beginning when they didnt have their shit together yet. Also at that time they had just opened the doors to the richardson warehouse so i thought maybe what he saw back then wasnt fully set up yet. They have recently moved from the old warehouse in richardson TX to the new one in plano TX to have SB/wolfpack/Vape all under one roof and then i started hearing the same rumors all over the place.. But now i have a real first hand account from Friend #1 who interviewed to run production. Their ENTIRE line of products to this day is made in an open warehouse/office with no environment control other than the A/C. No stainless steel tables, no gloves, no masks, no three stage cleaning process before you can even enter the clean room like everyone else does it. Not even a jiggy bottle of Germex laying around. I realize that 95% of you have never seen or will ever see an E-liquid production facility but it should be cleaner than a hospital. You should be able to lick the floor and have it taste good. There should be stainless steel everywhere. Absolutely NOBODY should be allowed inside the clean room that is not covered with masks, gloves, foot booties, and has gone through an extensive three to four stage cleaning process with separate rooms for each before entering the clean room. It should look like a pharmaceutical grade lab because thats what it should be. The facility my products go through costed the owner upwards of a million because he actually gives a fuck about peoples health. Now let me paint another picture for you. The Suicide Bunny/Kings crown/cloud company/Wolfpack/Vape Wild e-liquid production floor is NOT EVEN UP TO FOOD GRADE STANDARDS. it is literally dudes in t-shirts and jeans EYEBALLING flavoring/nic into large batches vaping while they work (a HUGE No-No for liquid production in case you arent familiar) and it gets worse.. Vape Wild Ejuice is under the same roof and is 100% eyeball mixed into individual 30ml bottles using plastic restaraunt supply ketchup bottles to store the flavoring/nicotine which was also not kept cold in a fridge/freezer (Ew) which is ESSENTIAL to maintain a good shelf life. they didnt even have an auto filling or labeling machine (standard practice) labels are still hand placed and at the time of Friend #1's week long interview an auto bottling machine had just been delivered and wasnt set up yet... Friend #2 has worked for WolfPack/SB for the past 2 years starting when we met. He just left them which is the main reason im able to post this now. Over the course of our friendship he has dropped some serious SB bombs on me. #1 and the most obvious, Pip with the school teachers degree did not come up with anything on her own as we are all lead to believe. They paid a lab to come up with the recipes and purchased it from them. every interview shes ever done she was lying through her teeth. I Vividly remember reading one that actually inspired me to start my own mixing where she claimed to have moved a kitchen table from their house into the SB office because it was the same table she was sitting at when she ""worked on"" all the original SB flavors.. TOTAL BULLSHIT. Well duh.. the pretty blonde didnt do all the proportional Algebra it takes to scale up the batches or come up with anything herself.. moving on. Also most of the images on their labels are stolen from an artist in LA but that is a very minor offense compared to everything else that is on the table here. I was told only one of the suicide flavors has original art work they actually paid for (sucker punch if i remember correctly) which completely makes sense because when you set them all next to each other that one sticks out quite a bit.. go look at them dont worry ill wait. Apparently said artist has never heard of suicide bunny or doesnt have enough money to sue them, latter most likely IMO. Now for the fun part! YES the recipe for mother's milk and all the others have been changed SEVERAL times due to the Diacetyl witch hunt which is why people are now complaining that it doesn't taste the same. What most people do not understand is that All E-liquid is undergoing a slow chemical reaction inside the bottle from when it is first mixed until the moment you exhale it. Im trying to keep this section as short as possible but basically the major Flavor companies everyone uses for Ejuice (Capellas/TFA/FW) have all taken WONDERFUL care with removing/replacing Diacetyl flavorings with AP but 90% of them never contained any D in the first place. Shit TFA even publishes MSDS lab test sheets for every flavor now. When AP reacts with nicotine it slowly produces trace amounts of diacetyl which is why aged/steeped juice tastes better especially those containing vanilla/creamy flavors. This is also how all the liquid companies can go around saying "Diacetyl AP Free!!!!!!!!" Because they send fresh mixed or Zero MG to the lab for testing, get their desired results to calm the public. No Diketones no Party. Bottom line. If your juice tastes any sort of creamy it contains some amount of AP/diacetyl Period (mostly AP these days) Is it bad for you? No. The FDA is the most corrupt agency in this country and has wanted to put an end to us since day one they HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PROVE that D/AP cause lung damage and have came up with NOTHING. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. There is nothing about D/AP in the new paperwork for regulation according to a vaping lobbyist in Washington DC i have connections with to get my liquids approved post regulation. they now KNOW its negligiable and wont poke holes in us like once thought. Now since you understand that we come to the greatest part of this whole post where I talk to you about mothers milk obsidian edition :D When everyone started freaking out about Diacetyl they immediatly began re-working the mothers milk recipe to use Capella's vanilla custard V2 which is the newer version with all D/AP/Diketones removed which is why mothers milk tastes like shit now. after this was done they now had all this old liquid stock that was deemed un sellable at the time because they werent sure if the diacetyl was actually dangerous to the public. Once they did their research and figured out its perfectly fine to use well.. now they have all this old liquid stock thats just sitting around that needs do be sold what can we do to get rid of it? Put it in a black 60ml bottle with an included "special edition" drip tip and sell it for Motherfucking 100$ per 2oz bottle. And while you're at it convince everybody that this is something you've been working on for the past 6 months and not a mistake you're trying to cover up. Honestly whoever came up with that is a fucking genius. I should hire that person haha anyway.. As we come to a close, fuck Suicide Bunny. Dont worry about Diketones and also here are the three ingredients that make up mothers milk in case any home DIY mixers would like to make your own without the shitty V2 custard: Cappella's sweet strawberry Cappella's Vanilla Custard (V1) Cappella's Graham Cracker Just play around with these its not hard to nail i promise. Hey while youre at it why not make it 80%VG since the original is only a shitty 60% VG haha i digress.. Thats right. The three ingredients that changed the world and fucked everyone over for 22$ per bottle (30ml of juice costs a home mixer around .85cents to produce &amp; around .35cents at production Quantity) i always laugh when I see clone recipes posted that include three drops of dragon fruit or two drops of mango because they swear they can taste it in there but really it's just the graham cracker / fruit combination playing with your tongue. You stay sexy reddit. Let the Down Votes Begin!!! 
If you fold jeans after the wash before you put them in the dryer, they hold there shape better. No more twisted pant legs and wind up knots with your jeans. 
I got these at your typical clothing store for $30, so not happy they didn't even last a full week. I'm a working man, so I don't go shopping unless I absolutely have to, and my last good work jeans met an untimely demise last week. I'm thinking somewhere like Bass Pro or Thyssens might have some more rugged options that will last me a lot longer. I do a lot of construction and welding style work, so I like to have the 'carpenter' style pockets. Other than that, I honestly do not care. I just want shit that works. Edit: Wow, this took off faster than I expected. Thanks for all the suggestions from everyone. It appears that the majority of you like the Levi's 501 or Carhartt jeans or Duluth. I'll probably swing by the local Thyssens tonight and see what they have in stock. Edit 2: Went out and got two pair of Carhartt jeans. One blue-jeans and one kahki. The Carhartt seemed to fit better and look like they'll last maybe even a bit longer than the Levis. Thanks for all the input everyone!

The Trouble with Men Dismantling Glory presents the most personal and powerful words ever written about the horrors of battle, by the very soldiers who put their lives on the line. Dismantling Glory is an original and compelling look at the way twentieth century war poetry posited new relations between masculinity and war, changed and complicated the representation of war, and expanded the scope of antiwar thinking.

Auden, tended to indict the whole of society, not just its leaders, for militarism.

Goldensohn argues that World War II blurred the boundaries between battleground and home front, thus bringing women and civilians into war discourse as never before.

Unlike that rascal Garfield I don't hate Monday's. I also don't hate mornings. Unless it's like 3am and I woke up in the middle of the night to pee or something like that. Then I just want to go to sleep because *FUCK THAT*! So K went to work and is probably going to have to work with Talky McTalkerstein. I feel bad for her, but she can't always have the perfect coworker. They coworker she liked was skimming off the tell and is probably in jail. It's a shame. Apparently she had just recently moved and had always been having trouble keeping up with her bills or something like that. Still not an excuse for stealing. And it's not like this is some corporate clothing store. It's a mom and pop shop that sells off brands of various clothing at discounted rates so anyone can have access to clothing. Yeah, they may fall apart after a year or several months, but it's like 10 bucks for a pair of jeans. You get what you pay for. Hell, if I hadn't bought a pair of Levi's last winter I would totally get 10 buck jeans. I'd buy that shit all day. But seeing that I'm fat and have short legs a 32" inseam is too big for me. That shit drags on the ground and I would have to make them shorts as soon as winter was over. Actually, I think I actually did that. Yeah! K bought me a pair of jeans while I was in the psych ward last and they barely made it through the spring because of the whole dragging on the ground and getting walked on. Oh well, they are good shorts. My mother has begun downsizing today. She contacted the housing authority at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to report an income change. Her usual case worker is no longer with them, which made my mother happy, and she has to write something and send in some papers. Chances are they will drastically reduce her rent which is a good thing. She also called the County Assistance Office and they're sending her a form so she can update them on her income loss. This should increase her SNAP credits and help her out even more. She has to call the cable company still to reduce the cable, if she can, and has to get in touch with AT&amp;T to talk about switching her number to this other phone she has and getting rid of my brother's minutes so he only has to pay for the minutes he uses which is like 6 a month. Why pay for 500 minutes when they're never used? N keeps burning incense. It fucking stinks. Seriously, it smells like they bought it at a gas station. I hate incense. It just reminds me of stoners and people who are trying to hide something about themselves. Like my dad. Who knows where the fuck he is and who really cares? I know my grandmother cares, but she cares about everything and subsequently gets hurt or depressed about everything. She needs to keep taking her medicine and see a therapist who will listen to her sob stories. God knows I've heard them 10,000 times. N lost his money on Saturday and hasn't even started looking for a job. I know most places are closed on Sunday, so you think he'd capitalize on the early hours of the day when things aren't really busy to go look for something. Nope. Not even a little. And, instead of him saving whatever money he has left he's talking about buying a PS4 and he was buying games on the Playstation Network yesterday for hours. I know I can't control him, and I wouldn't want to, it's just super frustrating to see someone care so little about their life. He still won't let my mother read his denial letter for some reason. There's a detailed account of the findings and every time my mother brings it up N gets angry. Whatever. Get over yourself, get a job and pay rent. If you can't do 2 of those 3 things then get the fuck out. Okay, good news: I hate Californians and their smug selves. Now I know that Northern Californians are better than those LA fucks, but I have to admit that they irk me something fierce. Now, there are exceptions. I'm pretty sure that u/ifoundxaway is a Californian, but she is an exception to this rule. Also, apparently most Oregonians hate Californians as well. It's a good thing I'm moving there soon. I'll fit right in. That's right, in the future I'm moving to Astoria, OR and going to become a Goonie. When I do move, and settle in, I will have fulfilled a life long dream of not only living on the west coast, but by living in the small town to end all small towns. I only bring this up because I am desperate to move in a way that no one on here can understand. In truth, anywhere is better than here. Man, I hope I get the letter with my court date soon. I need something in my life to change or go right for once. Also, I need to stop being so ridiculously symptomatic because K and my therapist A-K are pushing me to get on another medicine on top of my existing ones. I don't want to have to do that unless there's no other option. I put a call in last Friday during my therapy session to the Med Nurses line to discuss medication options and when they called me back (you have to leave a message because you can't directly contact someone), the lady didn't understand my symptoms and she said my shrink was on fucking vacation. Vacation! It must be nice to work 1 fucking day a week and need to go on vacation. Anyway, I need this week to go smoothly so I only need to adjust my current meds and not have to add another pill to my already 8 daily pills, not to mention my PRN's. Here's to epic dinosaur filled forests and baby Jesus being born in a cave, Andrew How are all of you?

In the cold mist of a May morning, a homeless vagrant struggles with a limp to make it down the sidewalk. He's carrying a large Styrofoam cup most likely filled with confusion, and maybe bourbon. It takes him the same amount of time to cross the entrance and exit ways of a MacDonald’s as it does for them to cook and sell ten chicken nuggets to a drive through customer. This is a very slow MacDonald’s. Irving Kenny watches this through the windshield of a dilapidated pickup truck, foot on break and clutch, waiting anxiously to hear the tiny window slide open and deliver his lazy choice of nourishment. The window opens and he reaches for the bag that will smell up his car. The insincere thank you that usually accompanies this transaction is interrupted by a smile as the paper-hatted worker notices Irving's attire. He is dressed in a shiny satin gown. Today is graduation day. Congratulations behind him, window rolled back up, he pulls the truck quickly into the roadway, barely missing the vagrant who is now three limps past the exit way. With the white paper bag as his open passenger, he switches between shifting the rotting gears of his mist frozen truck and cramming the increasingly less delicious bites into his mouth. Irving is late for pictures at Lana's house. Irving hates pictures. Lana is the richest of Irving's friends. Her house makes more sense to bring ten high school students together with their parents, plus Miguel makes the lawn look fabulous. Irving pulls his truck to the curb three houses down the block, he knows better than to try and park in that driveway because of the oil leaks, also the fifteen other cars surrounding the house. He creaks the door open and climbs out, immediately 27 people look the way of the sound his slamming truck door echoes. There have obviously been many pictures already taken, this he knows by the look on his mother's face. He jogs up the sidewalk as uncomfortable in the dress shoes he's wearing as the cup limping vagrant was with concentration. The usual greetings are waved by the time constraint; Irving appears in one panoramic photo, third to the right in a line of 10 pre-adults. Photos over, everyone moves to the school, they will start in the 150-year-old building and march, alphabetically to the gymnasium in caps and gowns. As they proceed down the stairs from the main hall the wind knocks no fewer than 12 caps off the 387 heads marching through the cool breeze toward their future. The kids file into seats, waiting to be announced adults. The parents fill the bleachers, overwhelming the scene with pride and disgusting amounts of hope and praise and fuckin clapping. Clapping overwhelms anything else that it going on, ever, but particularly here. Irving's best friend, Luscious gives the valedictorian speech. Nights before, he came to Irving for help, and Irving less smart, but somehow better with schmapp threw a paragraph his way; one of these makes the paper. It's something about wind and leaves and windows and passage, but is nonetheless misquoted by the paper. The school disallows any credit from Luscious for Irving, for an unknown reason. Anyways, there are cheers in embarrassingly uncordially different amounts as children pass to adulthood. After the glad handing ceremony, the adults fill the parking lots of the campus exponentiated by their parents. A cracking swoosh ignites the static hub-ub as Ethan Stone, a recent graduate, is torn from a congratulatory lack of accomplishment by a swooping sky-bound dragon. Yep, imagine the form you want, but life goes on regular, and sometimes there's dragons; for reals. In 2013 dragon attacks have passed AIDS on the list of leading causes of death in the US, and just like AIDS, middle America ignores the problem. The white insides of a Dixie cup disappear from Irving’s vision as he slams it down on the sticky ping pong table in the basement of Lana's house. Her parents mysteriously left for vacation shortly after the graduation ceremony. They are in no way skiing in New Zealand to alleviate the worry of their daughter's lack of social stature despite their great wealth. With the hollow ping of the cup onto the green plywood, Irving turns to his left and receives a vicious low five from his best friend and still grad cap wearing beer pong partner, Luscious. They are one cup from victory versus their waify opponents, Wendy and Simone. Wendy dips the ping pong ball into the most hideous cup of water the world has ever seen, and leaning way to the left, off purpose, she slings the ball “toward” the remaining 8 cups she and Simone are to conquer. Unfortunately the ball never makes it, but is adeptly caught by Irving before it hits the beer smattered wood floor. One toss from Luscious and the game is over. Wendy sits down quickly in what seems like quite a relieved manner for the defeated. Simone flips her scarlet hair and looks at Luscious, asking at an unnecessary volume, “Does anyone have a cigarette?” This ploy fools no one in the crowd, everyone knows Luscious begs the ignorance of his smart kid status by smoking cigarettes. Irving calls for a new game, and the conspicuous duo head upstairs to Lana's mother's rock garden to spread the ashes. “So what do you think about that shit with Ethan?” Luscious says sitting on the gardens bench and sparking the end of a crumpled cigarette from his cheap random, overtly image-laden pack. He shucks the pack toward Simone and three of them leap halfway from the pack. This is no accident, Luscious has practiced this move a thousand times in front of his bathroom mirror, accidentally soaking no fewer than 50 cigarettes in his sink. “Who?” is the only response Simone gives. As she takes one of the cigarettes, and lighting half of it, takes one French inhale and then just holds it to her side, while she stands in front of Luscious. She ignores all the smoke trailing from Luscious's mouth as it passes over her face. He looks up, she looks down. They go back inside and have terrible sex on Lana's bed. Meanwhile, downstairs, Irving and his new partner, Jack, are knocking down team after team in the ongoing, unorganized and very whoever calls it tournament of throwing a plastic ball three feet into a plastic cup. The world's ocean is being choked by this one tiny moment of teen lore. The army of re-dead zombies is falling quickly and the lights stay on in the room, but all they do is illuminate the bodies of 12-15 new adults lying in random spots on the floors, couches and nylon camping chairs of Middle America. Dawn breaks, then hours later the sun begins to heat up the house. Upstairs Simone and Luscious are woken quickly by the rising heat, with head aches and with an unbrushed smile, she looks over at one-sided disappointment. Luscious denies the heat by rolling off the bed to the cool carpet and searching for sleep again with the L of his arm blocking the sun. There are noises in the house. Movements are being heard throughout the house, toilets are flushing and all five showers in the house are burning the water heater simultaneously and cars are starting all over the block. This will be the first drunk drive for some, and the first hangover affected drive for more. Irving climbs the stairs and realizes this will be the first time he's done both, and with only one remaining contact lens. The other floats, filthy in the ping pong ball washing cup. Luscious sleeps through the noise, Simone walks her tangled hair down the stairs and barefoots it out the front door toward her six-year-old Mercedes. Cracking-swoosh..looks like scissored baby doll's red hair in Lana's front yard. Leaving high school behind is hard. Everyone is gone, and it’s Wendy, alone, rising slowly in a haze of evaporated half drunken cheap beer and its ability to combine its refuse with the plastic which makes the cups. The world of people have moved on and now in an empty basement, she’s left alone to rise and pull the knots from her hair and carry on in a world where she is as of yet unaware that her best friend is no longer. Wendy and Simone were super stars in high school. Quick to be the third or fourth best of their friends in college. She hears the silence throughout the house, but looks at the clock and realizes many a reason the other may have moved on. Grabbing a random toothbrush from the basement bathroom’s rack, she pours Listerine on it and then scrubs here pearly whites. A quick look at her beautiful face and a silent but sociopathic nod to a sideways grin she flips the collar of her sweater up and heads up the stairs into the yard. Not a car left, but a Mercedes she knows too well remaining in the yard. The wind and her strides kick the strands of red hair into her sight. There’s a smell of honey, she knows borrowed. She sees the scorched ground where a tiny plane may have crashed, and she knows..Simone. With yet another sideways smile, she politely walks around the crater and slides into the driver’s seat, presses the clutch and switches the key. With a thought no more grand than “fuck Simone,” she tears fresh grass into the burned ditch and works her way through the stress. 97 days. She has 97 days until life has to change. 97 days are between her and the future. And a quarter mile between her and Irving’s dead truck. With her speed, she barely sees the dying half-ton. Hood up and waiting; however, he’s there sitting on the tailgate. Until last night, they had not spoken, much. She’s super good looking and Irving survived at best during the awkward teenage years. But her in limbo, and with a freshly dragoned friend behind, she stops samaritanly to help a boy whose name she might barely know. She rolls the window down and clichédly asks whether or not the misty stranded boy needs help. Turns out he’s ready to take a ride. Wendy hates her own house so bad, she trades a session of bathing and a set of clothes from Irving’s older sister’s closet for a night of better than bad sex. A conversation follows the coitus mentioning the now slithered 96 days. A road trip is planned over uncomfortably smoked cigarettes that Luscious had left for his visits to Irving’s. There is a worry about the exploitation of Simone’s vehicle, and also about the unabashed skipping of her funeral. The dragons have made these ever obsolete. Graduation is over, and Wendy Simpson and Irving Kelly are ready to turn the page. They are up early, Irving’s mother is already off to work, and had been so into her nightly TV shows that she’d barely noticed her son, and much less an unfamiliar girl enter the house and proceed immediately upstairs. Irving packs a few days worth of clothes and a toothbrush into a duffel bag. “Ready to stop by your house?” he asks Wendy who is pony-tailing her hair. Removing the rubber band from her teeth, she blows out a sigh, rolls her eyes, “No.” She takes the duffle bag off the bed and carries it into Irving’s sister’s room, haphazardly grabs a few items from the dresser drawers and the closet, and shoves them into the bag, zips it up and tosses it to an open mouthed Irving. “You said she’s taking summer classes, right? She’ll never miss it.” Irving nods his head, lowers the bag to his side and just turns around and walks down the stairs. Irving is unfamiliar with such a cavalier outlook on things. He’s writing a note to his mother at the island in the kitchen. Wendy looks over his shoulder and then reaches under his arm to grab the paper. She crumples it up and throws it in the trash, pulls the pad of paper over hands him the pen “Camping with Luscious and a few other grads, got my cell if it works up there, otherwise back in a few days, love you, period” The smallest “But,” stars to come out from Irving’s mouth but he reclaims it quickly, realizing nonchalance she had in borrowing a dead girls car and away college strangers clothes, he had no chance in rebuttal. He wrote the note exactly and left it there conspicuously enough for his zombie mother to find it in between TV shows. “Alright, let’s go.” Wendy says with a frighteningly inflated sense of fearless exuberance. Irving grabs the bag, locks the door behind him. Wendy pops the trunk on the Mercedes parked curbside, which also went unnoticed by Irving’s mother. In the dragon times a lot of people are pretty sedated with prescription medications as to not be overwhelmed by the revolving door of coworkers and the endless need to attend funerals. Irving tosses the bag in and jumps in the passenger’s side. “Ready?” comes out of Wendy’s mouth more like a command and she’s geared the car and pulls off. “Where are we going?” asks Irving pretty shortly into the journey. “The bank first, I gotta take out the grad present money I got from all these people. You got some too, surely?” “Yeah,” and again ready to set up a rational argument against the frivolity of using the money, he instead follows his new hobby, going along with this strange pretty girl. Wendy is leaning out the Mercedes’ window at full reach to the drive up ATM, when a vibration hits Irving’s pocket. Realizing that it is not from glancing at Wendy’s butt in his sister’s surprisingly well fitting jeans, but rather from the cell phone he’d been hoping not to hear from for at least a few more hours. He takes the lit up phone from his pocket and breathes a sigh of relief, the screen says: Luscious. A tired sounding voice comes from the other side. “What’s up, Bro?” “What’s up? You just now getting up? The party was over yesterday morning” “Oh yeah, just getting up and around, spent the whole day recovering yesterday,” Irving knows this means smoking pot and laying in bed re-watching terrible movies. “Just stopped by your house to see if you wanted to go to that party at Jack’s this afternoon. Where are you?” “I’m..uhh..at the ATM, bout to—“ a small hand comes from behind his left ear and smacks the phone to the floorboard. “What the fuck?!” He yells, turning his shocked face to see Wendy’s right next to him holding the shh finger up to her lips and looking down at the phone. Irving puts up two palms with a silent “whoa” and reaches down to retrieve the phone from his feet. “Sorry, buddy, dropped the phone reaching out the window to grab my card.” “So now you have cash, meet me back over here at your place and we’ll go to Jacks, it’s $10 a cup anyway.” Irving looks to Wendy who is still close enough to hear the conversation for herself. She mouths the words “shopping for your mom, call ya later,” then gives a still used but now antiquated hand symbol for hanging up a telephone. Irving complies, slumps his shoulders and begins to examine his phone for scrapes or nicks, mainly to avoid eye contact. Wendy crams his card, folded in cash on top of the phone. She snaps a kiss on his cheek, pulls her sunglasses off her head and affixes them back on her face then roughly snaps the car in gear, allowing too much gas to deny a jolt from the bank line. Pulling just as carelessly into luckily light traffic, she gives a Bonnie Parker look into the rearview mirror, laughs and says “No surprises, no fun.” The Mercedes is flying by the time it reaches the freeway on ramp, Irving barely has time to see that it says south. There has been absolutely no discussion about where they will go or what they will do. The first stop is quite quick, actually, maybe 25 miles down the freeway. Wendy’s grand lack of plan didn’t even include checking the gas level of the car she’d taken from the estate of another short-sighted girl. A loud electronic ding was followed by a light on the dashboard. Irving lays his head back into the head rest in frustration, but as his limp neck is quickly tilted to one side, he opens his eyes to find a grinning Wendy has swerved quickly onto a nearly-missed exit ramp that just happens to be home to a blue highway sign with a picture of a gas pump on it. With the way she breaks at the end of the exit ramp, Irving is gaining no further faith in her driving. She takes a right into the large gas station. It is a typically buzzing place, the kind many a driver needs 25 miles outside of a city due to lack of travel calculations, not usually for one who didn’t fill up before he/she or they just haphazardly left that city. Wendy swings into the first available pump, pops her seatbelt off and says, looking upward out the driver window, “Pump 15.” Irving hesitates only a second for her to add in some cash, but quickly decides against a financial meeting this early on. Another electronic ding welcomes Irving into the chaos of the busy stations convenience store. Seconds after he becomes the second in line to put down his $50 dollars on pump 15, a small older woman behind him taps his elbow. She says nothing but points to the windowed wall. There’s Wendy banging on the glass yelling something Irving can’t hear. He gives the cupped hand to the ear and negative head shake. She harrumphes and walks the three feet to her right, opens the door, electronic ding, “pump 12!” exasperatedly. Wendy had pulled the car up to a pump with the gas door on the wrong side and had had to move. Irving came out into the warm breeze leaving the electronic ding behind ready to take the wheel and get some control over this young road trip; however, as his pupils comforted themselves with the sun he found himself walking toward a 90s Pepsi add. He still felt weird that they were his sister’s clothes, but with the wind and the sunglasses, and the one boot up on the side of the car, arms crossed, waiting for 50 dollars in premium gas to fill the tank, Wendy’s looks changed his mind. Pump secured and fuel door closed, there is no hesitation in Wendy’s flight. The last exit ever from a convenience store by an attentive old woman is confirmed by the glint deep in the rearview of a cracking-swoosh. Cruising to nowhere, Wendy stops bopping to the random local radio’s most recent static-riddled, “I’m hungry!” she exclaims, like the she does most of the short phrases that encompass her conversation skills so far in Irving’s experience. He looks around and doesn’t see anything up ahead. But before he can say anything the car is swerving and a soft little hand pulls his own onto the wheel . Wendy is leaned over him between the two seats scouring the floor board, not taking much off the accelerator to do so. Moments later, she pops back up with an open jumbo-sized bag of twizzlers, "Bitch, always has candy." Handing back the wheel, Irving mutters, "Had." “Are you finished yet!?” The voice growling out the passenger’s window is not helping Irving pee on the side of a highway in the middle of the dessert. There’s wind, he’s not big into going to the bathroom outdoors, much less in an increasing heat, in front of a pretty girl he’s only known for days. There are 93 days until the future and the last 3 have been spent riding in a widower car with a cute girl in dirty clothes and oversized sunglasses who is driving to what seems like nowhere and doing so really fast, like she has a place to go. If there were a budget to the trip, Irving would be more sure when they should be stopping and how; but the first two nights have been parked somewhere off the freeway, on some side road, leading to some fence they never open. Sleeping in a Mercedes would be worse if it weren’t for the gymnastic sex and the fully reclining seats. Sometimes there is passing traffic, mostly commercial vehicles, but never close enough to let them appear like more than any other abandoned car. And not everyone is as ready as Wendy to pop into a car left by a dragonned. Irving gives up, based on the minor calculations he’s crudely drawn up in his head, mostly through feel, and a sun dial he crafted from a cigarette aluminum, he’s almost certain it’s about time to stop for gas. Within 20 minutes, he is right. Without question of navigation, or search of any sort for approval, Wendy smiles a harsh turn onto an exit ramp. Again the blue gas sign, and a giant green one which for the first time gives a cardinal direction different than south. This time west. This particular exit holds an old fashioned truck stop. There is a lot going on, and the two traveling high school grads are among few cars between the 18-wheelers. When he walks out of the disgusting bathroom, horrified, and relieved, Irving looks over the top of the two-year-old, overpriced dvd rack and sees a familiar mess of dark hair, pulled up by sunglasses, lying over the hooded back of one of his own sweatshirts. One tiny hand is raising a cigarette and bouncing it within the realm of the beat of the loudspeaker music that plays from the Subway to the gift shop. He follows the ashen light house and ends up next to Wendy sitting in the middle of an almost empty row of 8 slot machines. 12 out of 15 cherries come by in the next few turns and Wendy is psyched to put $50 more in the Mercedes, but she also wants something more than twizzlers. So she orders pancakes. No coffee, just pancakes, and keeps smoking the cigarette. It is nowhere near enough time for the pancakes to have been made before they are on a tiny tray to the side of the seat where cherries keep coming for wreckless girl who seems to be jungle cat ready for everything except which side of the car holds the gas tank. “I like your sweatshirt!” she yells over the music that is not too loud through the first mouthful of her pancakes. Irving is commenting to himself how they should have just brought his entire family’s wardrobe, but then she pulls a giant, opaque plastic bad from the floor by her stool. It has the Hearty Throat Truckstop logo on it. She pushes it toward him. He takes the bag with one hand as he balances her plate from falling off the mobile tray with the other. “Oh, thank you,” is all he can muster as he pulls a new sweatshirt with the same HT Truckstop logo on it. About the time he’s pulled it over his head with the still attached tag slightly scratching his eyelid, she’s up, leaning over and cramming one last bite of pancake into her mouth. And walking out the door with another opaque bag slung over her own shoulder. Irving follows, heads to the Mercedes, wiping the slight trickle of blood from his nose onto the sleeve of his new sweatshirt, but realizes he’s alone. “C’mon!” Wendy is waving him into one of the terrible motel rooms attached to the truck-stop-aganza. He follows, and enters the worst lit room he’s ever entered which actually had a light bulb switched on. Laying on his back next to his sweatshirt and his sister’s sunglasses, and the smell of cigarettes and generic syrup, he plans to finally have sex outside his mother’s house, or a 6-year-old Mercedes. Instead Wendy starts talking, not growling or yelling, but leaning up where her elbow is bent so her hand can support her head while she looks at his ceiling-gazing face through an unnecessary pair of sunglasses "Where are we going?" he asks. "Let's not talk a about that yet," she says with a smile. "Tell me about you." Irving has no idea what to say. Wendy sits up against the headboard and pushes the sunglasses onto her head, pulling her hair back, she sees he's stumped by th locking of his gaze with the ceiling fan. "Tell me about your family, or something, 90 days together we aught to get to know each other better than we did in 12 years of orbital socializing in school." This is a different girl than the one who has been grunting and hammering the accelerator for the past few days. "You don't have brothers and sisters, right"?" "No, but my mom had four miscarriages, if that counts." She gives him a light shove in the arm that finally breaks his gaze from th hypnotizing, creaky ceiling fan. He looks up at her over his brow, she smiles big and pulls the sunglasses back down over her eyes. "What about your dad?" He knows that she knows, because Newton is not that big a town, and she'd've heard that he died. This is where they will pass into intimacy, and he knows it's her goal, so he decides, after only the moments that allow a fan to spin twice, he will tell her. He sits up beside her, but looks straight ahead at the off-tv sitting on the bank of way too many dresser drawers for anyone to need in a motel. "He died, before the dragons," He says in a certain remembrance. "He was flying to Dearborn, Michigan for a sales call, just a usual trip, he went on 50 of them a year, just selling fucking office supplies." Here he pauses because he's angry at the necessity for salesmanship and multiple copies played a part in the loss of his rock. She pushes his hair back over his ear and slides down to lay her head on his lap while he continues. "It was the leg from Minneapolis...the plane hadn't been up for maybe 30 minutes, the weather wasn't even bad, it was April." She knows the story; it was the last major airline crash in the US, 3 years earlier. "Planes don't fucking crash, bee stings, shark attacks...you know?" She just squeezes tight to his middle and nods, the sunglasses digging into his torso. Wendy falls asleep and Irving has a few moments with the ceiling fan and is right behind her. They split the single serving of Folgers before her foot's back on the gas, west once more. "Her" sunglasses on and grinning again at the highway, they move on, and she knows a little more of him. The first stop is for brunch at a family owned restaurant 12 miles from where they left. The young woman who meets them at the door is tall and fat in the way non-model tall girls are fat. They take a seat and learn her name is Lauren and she's the older of two daughters of the man and woman who own the place. Through the service window, the younger sister is hot-shotting the flat top grill. When Lauren returns from her seemingly solo duties, serving each of the other ten tables full of every sort of small town diner regular, Wendy orders a hamburger with and egg on it, turning from Lauren just after ordering, placing the back of her hand aside her mouth and silently mouthing “brunch” to Irving. Irving, still with the money discussion ahead of them, opts for the cheaper side of the menu and asks for a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup to the emphatic frowning of Wendy. Lauren is business-like as she quickly short hands the order onto her pad as she ends the session of her towering over their table with a quick smiley “thank you,” and scoots off with her long gate gilded for quickness and maneuverability through traffic and tables. “This place is one of my favorites,” Wendy says, looking around at the gaggle of folks. “I heard the mayor eats here.” “You’ve been here before?” “No, why?” “Well how is it a favorite and are sure there is even a mayor, I didn’t really see a town.” “How long does it take to make something ‘a favorite’?” she air quotes heavily, “And as for the mayor, who do you think that guy is?” she points an unabashed, arm full out, finger at a man sitting with four others, 3 tables behind Irving. Irving knows better 5 days into the trip than to correct her by lowering her hand, so he just puts his hands on the back of his chair and swivels his torso to get a conspicuous look of his own and the larger gentleman with slicked back brown and silver hair and poorly cut light navy blue suit. He quickly turns back to her and excitedly exclaims to her delight, “Oh shit, that is the fucking mayor!” She giggles and then turns stern again, “I told you.” Wendy continues with stories about random people from around the dining area, explaining who each of them is. Amid her explanation of the sheriff's deputy sitting behind her diagonally at a counter stool, Lauren arrives with their food. “Thanks, Lauren,” Wendy smiles, and receives a big “you’re welcome,” from their giant waitress. She sits upright with her hands on her thighs, takes a deep breath and then picks up the burger oozing with over-easy egg yolk and smashes into it with the hunger of the lumber jack she described at the corner table. Across from this accosting of beef, Irving gingerly dips his wedge of melted cheese on bread into the plane red liquid and takes a stingy bite, to make his meager nourishment last. He has barely picked up the second half of the sandwich when Wendy is wiping the rest of her egg yolk up with the final bite of her burger and last few french fries. Irving’s next dip and bite are bigger, as he feels the rush in her waving down of Lauren. Lauren finishes clearing some plates from the counter, nods and smiles and slides down to the end of the counter to punch up their check on the cash register. She walks it over, and before she can put the plastic tray with the receipt clipped to it, Wendy crams a hand into her jeans pocket and pulls out a wrinkled 20 dollar bill. “We’re good, thank you Lauren, you’re a beast at waiting these tables,” she pauses momentarily to wink at Irving, “tell your sister she’s awesome too, you guys got the wheels greased on this place.” Lauren looks down at what amounts to an 8 dollar tip and just says her “thanks, you two have a good one,” tucks the 20 and motors right along to the clear the next table, as the early lunch, or brunch, crowd checks back into their daily routine. During the exchange, Irving quickly finishes his last bit of soup and bread, and is already on his feet as Wendy growls without there being a question involved, “Ready, let’s ride.” They leave Lauren and her sister and their parent’s restaurant behind in a cloud the Mercedes kicks up from the dirt parking lot. And they go again, full gas toward somewhere. Irving thinks about the large man in the terrible suit, and wonders if he is really the mayor. They spend the next 12 hours on the road, mostly in silence, minus the radio and the humming of the tires on the road. After the last stop for gas, again, today, Wendy pays, she decides to leave the freeway behind and takes the 2-lane highway instead. Irving is still, has no response as to their destination, and as the sun creeps below the trees in the distant horizon, he thinks about how she hasn’t been using a map, no GPS, has not even asked anyone for directions at any point. She could very well be wandering, but is most definitely leaving him wondering. However, he just leans his head into the window and watches the purple sky turn dark, as he fades into bumpy sleep. The sun is up when he awakes to the warning ding of a car whose ignition still hold keys, but whose driver’s side door is open. Shaking off the cobwebs and the head ache that leaning against glass for hours will give you. The car is on a wide spot of a dirt road, a quick survey shows the highway only a little ways back. No Wendy. Irving gets out of the car. There is no wind, the morning is hot and the insects are loud. The bell continues to ding from within the Mercedes. Tired, wonder and panic attack his head at once. He crosses the road and looks down into the drainage ditch and even up in the trees. He walks 500 yards up the road on the side opposite the car. He listens and looks at the area around him. He is tempted to yell her name out, but knows it’s too early in the search. It’s Wendy after all, and this could just be another one of her tests of his character. She could easily be back at the car already. Somewhere in his heart and mind, he is awaiting that honk that will spill him humiliatedly back up the side road to learn another lesson in brazen. He takes the walk back to make sure this is not the case. He approaches the car, dual front doors open, dinging. He walks to the back seat and checks for a mischievous girl in sunglasses lying on the floorboard. No luck. He takes the car side of the road another 500 yards back toward the highway; there is only a ditch and a field, nowhere for her to hide. He checks the other side on the way back then crosses to the car side again to cover the area he hadn’t on the first side as he passes the car, dinging, again. He stops this time, checking the back seat for posterity and then reaches in and turns the key to off, pulling it out and ramming it in his pocket, slamming the driver’s door. It’s been at least 45 minutes since he awoke. Now he begins to return to the panic that his cool head had denied the first time. He’s looking for any evidence of her escape, anyway she could have gone, anyway that would’ve been her target for fun. He’s at least two miles up the road looking side to side like a marine in Vietnam. The terrain is the same; one side is a ditch followed by tress, the other is a ditch with a field beyond. The heat rises, and his frustrated worry mounts. Suddenly, looking up at the hot sun that is now high enough to bother his homeostasis with its beams, he has an idea. He turns back toward the Mercedes, easily more than 2 miles away, and sprints, his ineffective shoes slipping at first motion. Though his pace slows, he doggedly trudges forward. The car gains proximity in his blurring gaze. He finally arrives, only the passenger door left open, he heaves, breathes in passed the sweat that is encasing his body and dripping over his lips into his gasping mouth. When he takes his hands off his knees and stands up straight, he begins the new search, circling the car, this time not looking for Wendy, but scorch marks. Where is Wendy? When there are dragons, the rule is you never give anyone’s search more than 30 minutes. Irving has been pacing the road for two hours. Soaked from wading in the creek that flows beneath the roadside trees, he has returned again to the Mercedes. Head in hands, he sits on the hood just to the left of the iconic ornament. Since their arrival, there has never been a report of a person encountering a dragon and getting away. What else could it be; where the fuck could she have gone, and why. Terror and frustration plague Irving’s heart as he stands from the hood and circles the car, slamming closed the still open passenger door, continuing around to the driver’s door. He has dry clothes in the bag that is lying in the back seat, but he just slumps his wet-panted body into the seat which is Wendy-close to the steering wheel. He slides the seat back, practicality overwhelming the gravity of the situation. This will be his first time driving on the trip. He turns the key and pulls the gear into D. The windshield wipers kick on, and the dry rubber on the glass grabs his attention. On the other side of the distraction are sunglasses, messy hair and a head wound walking with Wendy up the hot dusty road. The digital presentation of gears gets from D to P in a second. Irving kicks the driver door open and uses all his physical capability to lurch his wet jeans into a semi-sprint. He catches a wobbly, bloody Wendy before she wobbles to the dirt road. Unable to be in two places at once, he drags her like a drunk cowboy, heels in the dirt and lays her on the hood of the Mercedes. Meanwhile, he rips open all four doors and rips the floor mats out, then lays them in a rectangle of oblong rectangle-esque shapes in a row on the dirt, after scattering any underlying rocks, forming a makeshift stretcher which will never be lifted from the ground, but which may keep some of the dirt from her hair/wounds. He lays her down, already with a motel towel soaking up as much blood from the head wound which is elevated by yet another motel towel or two. There are a million thoughts. Too many are panicked. Irving is immediately wondering what he is going to do, how he got here, how he will explain it, if at all. Then there is a focus to the crimson-headed blonde on the mat in front of him. He is lost. If only Luscious were here. He'd be smart enough to somehow figure out an immediate decision of what to do with a tragically wounded pretty girl. “Wendy! Wait!” Her slightly elevated head, still-sunglassed, turns slightly with the most asshole smile a pretty girl can give. “Just keep turning left, but driving far in between,” she mutters incoherently. Irving reaches his non-cradling hand to lift the sunglasses from her eyes, but her limp left hand comes alive and catches him at the point of contact. “No. Just remember.” “Fuck!” Irving extends the word into the beautiful sky that looms over his misery. He has no idea what to do. So he does what he thinks he should. He stands above the empty body of his knee-jerk companion and looks back to the Mercedes. He then looks down the road from whence she came. Just past the dust up where he grabbed her fading body, he sees drips of her blood. He walks back the brief distance to the back seat of the car. He pulls his clothes from his bag. He throws everything he has in his pockets from his wet jeans into the seat. He strips the wet jeans to the dirt. Naked in front of no one in the world he leaves those jeans behind. With only the wallet from his pants and a new set of dry clothing, he stomps back to the blood drops. He strides directly over Wendy's body in defiance of the universe's right to make her sacred. Sometimes there's first love, like for reals. Irving walked that road for a long time. He eventually followed her path in retrograde, finding an encampment of rural crazies. He likes to imagine that she was just Wendy and they couldn't handle that. And perhaps her running cost her. But just in case, he lit a hay fire with his lighter and a dollar bill from his wallet. These days who would know the difference. And whomever fucking ruined her life had subsequently ruined his; so fuck it. With her memory and absolution, Irving returns to the road and walks back to the highway. Early on the second morning he passes the Mercedes; however, the front end is blackened, and Wendy's corpse is gone. He wanders around the crater left in front, leaning only from exhaustion. Reaching the highway, he looks to the right, breathing in winded up dust and wiping a rough-surfaced inside wrist over his over-exposed eyes, sees a service station within a walk's distance. The road is no less dusty, despite the asphalt. It can't be but a half mile, but the weight of what is behind drains every step. What is gone is more in front of him than his footsteps. “Fuck,” he thinks, “If only it had been a dragon.” Whirlwinds aside, it can't be 9 minutes before he meanders across the highway, not even checking left or right, into the service station parking lot. The service station has that smell of dirt on linoleum, heated through glass by the desert sun. The tattered polo of the employee tears away any hope of service or someone attending to anything but the bare minimum. Irving pees inside for the first time in a few days. He peruses the shelves of instant garbage for a minute before reclaiming his lack of hunger. The rattling of the back of the truck bumps his head into the steel body of a shitty pick-up and Irving is awake. The sky tells no story to where nor when he is. Stinging dust welcomes his eyes from REM. There's that haze that accompanies any rebooting of a groggy human brain. A quick scan of the bed and this truck is full of 7 others, holding their forearm across the apexed knee to support the often slumped heads. 
hey folks! I'm not really familiar with this that's why I need your help. I'm looking for a product that can restore the blackness of my jeans. I wonder what brand and where I can buy it, anyone? :/ 
Have you ever wondered WHY terrorists are blowing up a seemingly random stack of boxes? If so, you're asking the right questions. I can't speak for all terrorists, but I can speak for terrorists from Dust 2. Have you noticed how well the terrorists are dressed? Fashionable jeans, sunglasses, scarf, lots of accessories, etc. Clearly, they are keeping up with the fashion and care about their clothes. Have you noticed what counter-terrorists are wearing? Uniforms. Plain, boring uniforms. How do terrorists sound? They greet each other with encouragements such as "There you go" or "my friends", when surrounded by enemies they yell "ahh, I need help here". In short, they don't sound threatening or evil at all. The worst thing they say is "We will drive them from our land" which can only mean they are offering the CT-s a ride home. How do counter-terrorists sound? Arrogant, aggressive, patronizing with phrases like "We're wasting time, let's go" or "The mission is simple, take them out". Once again, it's clear that CT-s have an evil agenda in this. You see, CT-s are enforcing a way of life the terrorists cannot accept. They are trying to make everyone wear the same uniform and remove all possibility of unique, personalized accessories in clothing our beloved "terrorists" enjoy. Those boxes there on A and B, those are boxes full of those uniforms, ready to be unpacked and forced upon the locals. Five heroes have decided to fight for their right to wear clothes they want, and unfortunatly the only way to do it is to destroy the uniforms, all 16 shipments worth of uniforms. This is not the start of it either. CT-s first destroyed their cars, limiting their transportation options to their "Train", and it certainly won't be the end of it, if no one fights back. If it were up to the "terrorists", they wouldn't kill a single person. All they want to do is blow up the uniforms. But CT-s are actively trying to stop them, and they don't care if it means killing them all. Truth uncovered by my friend Timmy and me. Honerable mention: friend Ahajir. Spread the word, restore the good name of terrorists! PS: Predator is the greatest movie of all time

Hello Bangaloreans, I am moving to Bangalore from Jalandhar and I am sure I will have trouble finding jeans my size. I am about 207 cm(~6'10 in old currency) which makes clothes shopping hell. I came across only 1 store in Mumbai which caters to my frame. Can anyone suggest a store in Bangalore which caters to tall peopl? P.S. My exact inseam is 37 inch but 38 works fine too. 
I cannot describe to you how I feel right now. What I’m experiencing is so detached from the normal, I’m almost convinced I’ve finally gone insane. Almost. My wife, Bea, died during childbirth. She was gorgeous, funny, intelligent – stubborn. A woman whose laugh was so loud eating in restaurants was a challenge, and whose stare was so intense it made my hands shake. I lost her, as she gave birth to our daughter. Sam. Of course, I could have resented Sam. For taking away what was once mine in a way nothing else can be. For taking what was so truly and utterly pure. But I didn’t. I knew Bea wouldn’t have wanted any resentment. She wouldn’t have wanted our only child to have a life ruined by hate. But this isn’t about grief. This isn’t about the physical sucker punch of losing forever something you loved. This is about something far more sinister. My daughter was lively, always running and screaming, leaping up and down the climbing frame – causing havoc in her nursery classes. So for her sixth birthday, a trip with friends to the movies had left her so pent up with energy I could barely keep up with her as she dipped and dodged between people on the pavement. She’d occasionally turn back, through the sea of people and shout “Daddy, come on!” in a tone that was almost petulant. I couldn’t help but love her. I tried to chase her, I really did. She was too busy looking at me when she dashed out into the road, and the bus didn’t have time to stop. A sickening crunch, and the world fell silent. I cradled her broken form in my arms, too numb to weep, too hurt to move. All I could feel was the warm blood gently seep into my clothes. In the state of shock I was in, I could just think about how I was going to wash my jeans. It sounds horrid, I know – but a loss like that tears everything away from you and leaves you with only the bare thought process that make us human. The next week was a blur. I cannot place a single memory to a time, in between friends and family extending their condolences, and the howling sobs of mine that would break out at any moment – a door slamming, the gentle hum of the fridge or voices laughing on the radio. I attended her funeral dressed all in black. By dressed, I don’t mean merely clothes, my very essence was dark. I couldn’t feel, or think and the day continued as I went through the motions, like a dying man treading water. Everyone wanted to tell me about Sam, and how perfect she was – what an angel she was, as if I didn’t know. As if I didn’t realise what a gift my own daughter was. The man, stood out from the rest, as he walked up to me and handed me this large leather book. I assumed, at the time, he was a parent of one of Sam’s friends, handing me a collection of their photos together. Or maybe I was too numb to even process his cold hands, and how he never mentioned my daughter once. For a month, I was lost. I drank, and stayed in our now empty apartment alone, watching old boxsets – too numb now to even cry. It was only when my sister arrived, when she held my hand and talked to me that I began to come out of my shell. She’d sit and listen to the most inane things I said, and gently coaxed me out of my depression. Not completely, but enough for me to begin to live what was almost a real life again. That was when I opened the book. I’d decided to remember Sam for all the joy she gave, and was prepared to reflect on her life without feeling miserable. I opened to the first page. It was essentially a binder, full of Polaroid photos of my daughter growing up. I furrowed my brow. They were taken from a distance, blurred slightly – and I was in a few of them. I began to feel sick, but hoped that the following photos would provide some explanation. I came up with every excuse of how the man obtained these photos, desperate to view the moments of my daughter’s life without a sense of trepidation. The photos grew closer and closer to my daughter’s birthday. I could see the day I gave her a tiny bike after she turned five, and the skinned knees that ensued. The book had so many more pages, that I assumed the rest were empty. But there was a photo of her just before the movies on her sixth birthday - I could recognise the pink raincoat she insisted on wearing, and my hands on her shoulders. There was no photo of the crash. Instead, her life continued inside this book. Her seventh birthday had a photo of me and her in the garden, covered in paint – with a huge canvas on the floor and an extremely messy painting. Her seventh birthday. Her seventh birthday. The reality of what I was seeing hit me then and I slammed the book shut. I sat there, at the kitchen table staring at the leather. This must be some sadistic photoshop, I hoped, someone had taken the time to pull a horrid prank on me. I say I hoped, because essentially – I couldn’t believe the other explanation. If there even was one. Gritting my teeth, I decided I had nothing to lose and kept reading. I can’t explain the emotions I felt whilst I read accurately, listening to the sound of the page turning. I can try, but nothing could prepare you for something like this. Her life continued, showing her losing her baby teeth, her first day of senior school. My turning of the pages became more frenzied, and I began to notice something. The photographer was getting closer. Closer to her. As she grew older – not in every photo, but a general trend – the photographer was getting closer and closer. More daring, perhaps. She was beautiful. Stunning. As a teenager she looked just like her mother, all curls and smiles. I grew older too, but the photos began to include me less and less. Her sixteenth birthday was strange. A group of her friends, sitting outside, drinking from little plastic cups at a picnic. But there was someone in the background. Near the bushes of the park where this was taken, a dark figure stood. You wouldn’t have noticed him, if not for the small shadow he cast on the grass. I leant back for a moment and exhaled. This was too weird. I’d been so caught up in watching my little girl grow up I hadn’t thought about how this would end. Moments like this, are so utterly surreal that sometimes you remove yourself from them. I almost felt like I was watching myself read these, like this was a dream, or a program on the television. I continued. The dark figure became more and more present in each photograph. I could almost make out features. His presence was towering, and as I turned the page I expected to see him disappear. But instead, as the photographs grew closer to her eighteenth (each birthday was marked by a caption underneath the Polaroid saying “Another year.”) she was no longer somewhere I recognised. Instead, the photos were of her in a dimly lit house. Her face contorted by fear, striking all sorts of weird poses. Sometimes she would be dressed like an ancient queen or she would be dressed like a maid scrubbing the floors, the figure was there even closer now. His legs, or his arm would appear in each and every one. No matter how she was dressed, in every photo her face had this desperately pained expression. It killed me. There were bruises on her face. She looked thin, ill even. I couldn’t do it. This was sick. Properly sick. My girl. I soldiered on. The last photo I looked at, before I slammed the book shut and swore to never, ever look at it again was of her eighteenth. The caption underneath read “At last!” in sloppy writing. She was looking straight at the camera, crying. She was on her knees, dressed in a black evening dress – with an apple in her mouth and her hands bound behind her back. Her makeup was ruined by her tears. It was as if she was pleading me, begging me to help. But I couldn’t. I closed the book and left the room, my whole body convulsing with sobs. I couldn’t call the police, of course. [She was The thing that keeps me up at night, isn’t the content of what I saw. It’s that there were so many pages left.

Why are there metal nipples on my jeans? I get that they are for reinforcement of the seams or something like that, but why do they have these little extrusions, is there some meaning for the shape? Wouldn't it be better if they were just flat? 
8 days ago I decided to stay at the library so that I could get some studying done. I was walking home from the train station, it was pretty late and I had headphones in my ears so I didn't hear anything. I suddenly felt this huge blow to the back of my head. I went down instantly, I was in this weird half-awake half-asleep state. Everything was blurry but I saw a guys feet beside me as my jeans were pulled down from behind me. I assume there were two guys, but there could have been a lag between what I felt and what I saw. It felt almost like a hallucination. I felt like I could barely move but I know that if I had actually tried I could have. It was in slow motion. At a certain point I passed out. I woke up around 15 minutes later and walked home. My girlfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. We have a great relationship but one thing I have always had trouble with is being vulnerable around her. I've never cried in front of her or showed any sort of weakness or insecurity. I'm not even sure I know how how. I know that she would support me if I told her what happened, I have absolutely no doubt about that. But it worries me that she might lose attraction to me because of it. Not in a knowing way, but in a way that is out of her control. I want to tell her. I want to be able to hold her and let some emotion go, but I don't want her to think any less of me and I don't want to lose her. Women are attracted to masculinity and although they say they want a man who can be sensitive, they are always attracted to the most 'manly' of men, the ones who are a rock at all times. I'm not sure what to do. My head stopped bleeding the next day and you can't see the cut through my hair, so there's nothing she's noticed physically. But I haven't been able to have sex with her since it happened, and she's noticed. Maybe I could just tell her that a couple of guys hit me out of nowhere? I think that might be better. How would I even begin to talk about something like this? It all seems so ridiculous. Some advice would be great. **tl;dr**: Should I [M19] tell my girlfriend [F19] that I was raped? 
I have been a &gt;50" waist for as long as I can remember. Today, I bought a pair of 46" waist jeans. I'm absolutely ecstatic!

A little description about myself before I continue my story. * 20-year-old male * virginity is strong * American born Chinese * visiting China; vacation * not fluent in Chinese (Mandarin) Also, to those Reddit users that know me in-real-life, please **DO NOT** expose me. I already have enough problems to deal with. This event did not occur today, but two nights ago, however, it wasn't until now that I mustered up the courage to post this, because I need advice too. **Long Story:** Anyway, at approximately 5:25 PM, on a Friday, my cousin had voice called me on QQ (China's version of Skype), recommending me to visit a legitimate massage parlor (I have been incredibly sick throughout the entire week; lung infection). Apparently, in Chinese tradition, a massage, and drinking boiling water will cure ALL diseases (sarcasm). Fast forward, 20-minutes-later, I threw on a polo t-shirt, skinny-fit jeans, and a leather jacket, then I headed outside. Now, the city that I am located in has two major streets, packed with various Chinese 'mom &amp; pop' restaurants, and miscellaneous stores. Already walked halfway down the dirt road, on the first street, I noticed a stained picture sign of a white lady rubbing a man's back, plastered on the window pane of a shabby, rundown building, and a rusty metal fence that blocked the inside view. I walked into the massage parlor, only to be greeted by a Chinese lady. Moments later, a pot-bellied bald man had appeared from behind the curtains of a room. The sketchy man had requested my purpose. I responded in broken Chinese, informing the man that I sought after a massage. No fucking joke, the bald-headed guy stated in nearly perfect English, "Happy ending?" Originally, my only intention of visiting a massage parlor was to receive a legitimate massage. However, since I was already here, and I was prepared to lose my virginity, I gave up my integrity, and said fuck it. I smiled, then gracefully nodded, handing the sketchy man ¥400 RMB (equivalent to $65 USD). The pot-bellied man informed me in Chinese, stating that he'll select his best employee. Afterward, the greeting lady had led me into the 3rd room, opposite direction of the receptionist table counter. The greeting lady had given me a pair of robes and a towel, then informed me to undress, only to leave me by myself. This wasn't my first massage so I knew the basic procedure. After I undressed and wore the uncomfortable satin, I laid face-front on the cushioned tabletop. 15-minutes later (I think, only to be fatigued from waiting so long), I hear the lady's footsteps, hand washing, and the aroma of burning incense, do I finally feel the womanly touch of her hands caressing my back. Moments later, I felt an oily sensation, and the towel wrapped around my waist being untied. Now, prior to my "dingleling" being fondled, I had already grew a chubby in the nether region. As the lady pulled my half-erect penis between my legs, I felt her fingertips massaging my foreskin. Fast forward, 5-minutes later, when I had already pre-ejaculated, and gradually moaning louder, I asked in broken Chinese, "How much for penetration?" She stopped; dead silence. Momentarily, I slowly raised my head, and turned around, only to be facing an elderly man. I jumped up and screamed, "WHAT THE FUCK!?" Later on, I was informed by the bald man, at the receptionist table, that the elderly man, with feminine hands, was legally blind. How does that make my situation even better? Anyway, I received a compensation for ¥200 RMB, because the man at the receptionist table had concluded that I was a homosexual, judging from my skinny-fit jeans, and double pierced earlobes. Fuck my life. **TL;DR:** I visit a shady massage parlor to experience a "happy ending," only to UNEXPECTEDLY receive a penis jerk session from a legally blind elderly man. **Now, this is the part where I ask Reddit for advice.** The old man had rubbed a green herbal essence on my genitals, and I had formed a series of rashes, only to remind me of my regrettable decision to visit a massage parlor in China. What are some home remedies to heal these rashes? I'm too embarrassed to visit a hospital, no matter how cheap it is. **EDIT:** Thank you to for the Reddit Gold Star Coin. I am not exactly certain on what it does, but I am extremely flattered that you were willing to spend money to support my cause. 
Hey ladies, I know I'm not alone in this...For us girls whose thighs touch, why hasn't anyone invented reinforced inner thigh jeans? That's the first thing to go on some of my favorite pants! It goes from thinning fabric to gaping holes in a matter of weeks. I really wish some designer would take note and lend a hand to us thigh-touching ladies of the world! 
I own a navy sport coat and wear that to work from time to time. I'm considering getting a black sport coat for business casual wear and for going out. aside from black denim and charcoal pants I can't think of another pair of pants to pair with a black sport coat. Shirt combinations can be tricky too, with white and grey button down shirts working with it. ________________________________________________________ For work: Black sc+ white ocbd/gray ocbd+charcoal pants (solid or check) Black sc+ white ocbd/ gray ocbd+ navy pants? Black sc+ white ocbd/gray ocbd+ black denim (casual Friday) or dark blue denim, although I'm not sure if the dark blue jeans work here - note I could add a gray or charcoal sweater with these outfits. Would midgray pants work with a black jacket? __________________________________________________________ For the outside of work: Black sc+ white ocbd/gray ocbd+ black denim Black sc+ white t/gray t/charcoal t/black t+ black denim (shirts can be long sleeve too) Black sc+ previous shirts+ more casual charcoal chinos - can add a sweater in black, gray, or charcoal into the mix Is There a reason why you wouldn't get one? 
Hi there, does anyone have any recommendations for dark denim jeans that feature high quality construction (selvedge?) and materials but isn't raw denim? I've been considering the typical recommendation of Levi 511's in Rigid Dragon but was wondering if there was anything of a "higher tier". I love dark denim jeans and many brands have some awesome raw versions but I'm not really interested in any fading. My favorite fit I've experienced thus far is [APC's New Standard at Context though it seems one other New Standard's were a little tight in the thighs for my liking but that might be to account for the stretch that comes with raw denim or the fact that I got them "lightly used" from a seller on ebay. I apologize if I completely overlooked a similar question being asked in the past. Any input is much appreciated! 
What is the deal with this guy dancing around the Gottingen Street and Agricola Street area in short jean shorts and red shirt? He's been approaching businesses for work. Seems like he is on ecstasy or something. You can also see him on you tube by searching Hans Trooper. 
I remember specifically being about 15-16 years old and learning that bootcut jeans were definitely the most flattering for nearly all women because they helped create a 'balanced figure'. Additionally, straight or skinny jeans were only in the 'mom jean' category. Recently I read something that said that bootcut jeans aren't flattering because they create width in an area you're not expecting it, which looks weird. I'll be going to shop this weekend for some jeans, so now I'm just really confused. Is this just fashion being malleable? Or are some of these things just wrong? 
Of course Inferno made it possible for Cyclops to find redemption since Madelyne Pryor ended up being a clone of Jean Grey (what is it with Jean Grey constantly being cloned or possessed throughout her history) turned evil, but even if Madelyne was all of these things, Cyclops didn't know that when he chose to leave the Family he created. You could say it was his irresponsible and selfish behaviour which led Madelyne to lose her marbles and embrace the dark side. I don't remember the entire affair, but did Jean know Cyclops was married and with a son when he eloped with her? 
With spring/summer basically upon us, I know that there's going to be an influx of people asking where they can get lightwash/bleached/light stonewash jeans.

Taylor had just moved to our neighborhood about a week ago, and she was staying with my friend Rachel while she looked for a place to live. I’d met Taylor a couple of times at the coffee shop where she worked. She didn’t think I knew, but she obviously had a huge crush on me. With my boyfriend out of town for the weekend, Taylor and Rachel were planning to come over, hang out, and maybe watch a movie. I was intrigued by the possibilities of getting Taylor alone, so I texted Rachel and asked her if she could stay home. “No problem,” she responded. “You two have fun ;)” Taylor arrived at my apartment after her shift at the coffee shop, wearing a cute blue dress with an enticingly short skirt. She slipped off her shoes and followed me to the kitchen where I made us drinks. “What would you like?” I asked her. “Just some soda for me, Jennie. Anything stronger and I’ll get silly,” Taylor tells me. “Silly can be fun, but OK,” I teased her. “So when does Rachel get here?” Taylor asked me. “Rachel couldn’t make it, so it’s just us. We can do anything we want,” I smiled, then leaned over and kissed her on her lips. Her mouth opened and our tongues touched for a few seconds, then I pulled away. “See, anything we want.” Taylor was flushed and looked like her heart was racing. “What’s wrong?” I asked, “you look you’re going to faint.” “No, I’m fine, Jennie,” she said quietly. After fixing our drinks, we went back to the living room and sat on the sofa. When she sat down, Taylor’s little blue dress lifted up enough for me to get a glimpse of her panties. “Those panties are so cute!” I exclaimed, and Taylor looked like she would die of embarrassment, pulling her dress down to cover them. “No, seriously, what’s that pattern on them? Let me see!” I coaxed her. “Lift your skirt up a little so I can get a better look.” She hesitated and raised her skirt enough for me to see a glimpse of the black panties with some sort of white dots. “Those really are so, so cute. But I want a better look.” I stood up and faced her. “Just take them off for a minute and let me look at them.” “What? Are you serious?” She asked me incredulously. “Look, it’s just us, they’re super cute, and I want a better look. Just slip them off and hand them to me. You’ve still got your dress on.” I struggled to keep a straight face as it started to look like she believed me when I told her this was perfectly normal. Taylor still looked nervous, but she slipped off her panties and handed them to me. I flattened them out and held the up in front of me. “Oh, those are stars!” I exclaimed, and made a show of studying them carefully. After a few moments of this, I gave her panties a quick kiss on the crotch and handed them back to her. “Here you go.” She blushed and looked puzzled, but slipped them back on and we turned on the TV. We browsed through the listings for a while, looking for something to watch, but didn’t see anything that looked interesting. “Really, watching anything is fine with me,” she told me. “No, none of these shows look interesting to me either.” I jumped up from the couch again, “I know a great game we can play!” I turned off the TV and turned the lights down lower, still giving us enough light to see, but maybe dim enough to relax her. “You just stand here in the middle of the room and keep still,” I told her. “How does that sound?” “OK, Jennie, but then what do I do?” she asks me, and she stands still and straight in the middle of the room with her arms by her sides. “I’ll tell you as we go,” I smile reassuringly. I stand behind her and run my fingers lightly down the outside of her arms from her shoulders to her finger tips. I kiss her lightly on the back of her neck. From only the contact of my lips with her neck, I can feel how her heart is racing. “You just need to relax,” I tell her. I undo the clasp of her dress and unzip it, then start to lift it over her head. “What are you doing, Jennie?” she asks, and starts to cross her arms. “Really, Taylor, there’s only one rule so far and you’re already having trouble. Just hold still.” She puts her arms back down, and I keep lifting her dress. “Well, OK,” I laugh, “I do need you to raise your arms so I can get this over your head.” And she does. In addition to the black panties with the stars, she’s wearing a black lace bra. I run my fingertips lightly down the outside of her arms again, then in circles on her back. Next I move my fingers over the outside of her bra, lightly tracing circles around the tips of her breasts. When I unclasp her bra and start to remove it, she stiffens a bit. “Hold still, Taylor,” I tell her. “Don’t you trust me?” “I do,” she says quietly. “Say, yes, I trust you Jennie,” I instruct her. “Yes, I trust you, Jennie,” she agrees. “Good girl,” I praise her. I’m still standing behind her, and I slip my fingers inside the waistband of her panties and slide them down her legs and around her ankles. I run my fingers down the outside of her legs, slowly from her hips down to her ankles. “Step out of your panties and spread your legs just at little wider, but keep standing straight,” tell her, and she does. Now I trace my fingers up the insides of her legs. I lightly touch her pussy, and I can easily feel how wet she is. I take her by the hand and start to lead her to the bedroom. “Follow me,” I tell her. “You trust me, don’t you?” “Yes, Jennie,” she says. This is going to be fun, I smile to myself. When we reach the bedroom, I have Taylor face the bed and bend over with her face and shoulders touching the bed. Taylor is naked, and I’m still fully dressed in my jeans and t-shirt. Her legs are straight, so her butt sticks out high. “You’re so flexible, Taylor,” I tell her. “And you’ve got such a sexy butt. It’s a perfect shape, and it’s so nice and pale.” I use my hands to gently stroke her back, then the backs of her legs, then the smooth curve of her sexy ass. Suddenly, I bring my open hand down hard on her right cheek, making a loud smack! She gasps, and tears start to well up in her eyes. “Oh, sweet Taylor, you didn’t do anything wrong. I want to see how your cute ass looks after a spanking, when it’s nice and bright red on top of your pale skin. It’s ok if I spank you, isn’t it?” I ask her. “Yes, Jennie,” she sniffs a bit. I kiss the tears that are just starting to overflow from her brown eyes. I stand on her left and caress her ass with my hand for a few seconds, then go back to spanking her. I strike each cheek hard five times with my right hand, then step back to look. “I wish you could see it, Taylor. Your sexy butt is such a nice red now. You should thank me for making it even cuter,” I smile and look at her. “Thank you, Jennie.” She says meekly. “Good girl,” I tell her. “Now we’ll try something that you’ll enjoy even more.” I have her roll onto her back on the bed with her knees up and apart. I kiss the insides of her thighs softly, working my way closer and closer to her pussy, then run my tongue between her lips, barely touching them. She moans and lifts her hips, but I pull away. “Before I spend more time on your soaking wet pussy, I’m going to have you lick me for a while,” I tell her. I finally remove my clothes, taking of my shirt, jeans and panties, all that I was wearing. “You look like you’d be too timid if I let you on top,” I tell Taylor. “So I’m going to straddle your face. I want you to get your tongue as far into my pussy as you can. If it’s not deep enough, I’ll have to push harder and you won’t be able to breath.” Then I smile. “If you really have trouble breathing, tap my thigh and I’ll let up a little.” I pause, “Unless I’m about to cum. Then you’ll just have to hold your breath longer.” Just like I explained, I straddled Taylor’s face and lowered my pussy onto her mouth. She licked me eagerly and hungrily, seeming much more experienced than I expected from her innocent looks. I pressed down harder on her face and she licked faster and deeper, sending waves of pleasure over my body. I let up briefly and she gasped for air. “More,” she begged, and I lowered myself onto her again. We continued like this for a long time, Taylor licking and sucking, and me giving her air from time to time. Finally, I moved off of her face and laid down next to her. She was still on her back and I laid on my side facing her. “Mmm, very good girl, Taylor,” I purred. I slid my hand down her stomach and teased her lips with my fingers. She was still as wet as I remembered, and I slid one finger inside, then easily slid in a second. I worked the two fingers deep inside her, slowly at first, then faster and harder. Eventually, I was pounding my fingers into her soaking pussy and listening to the wet sounds that it made. Taylor moaned and lifted her hips, finally trembling with her orgasm. It was getting late by now and I was ready to rest. I curled around Taylor and she snuggled against me. I was tired and relaxed, but I could feel how excited and restless she still was. “That was so incredible, Jennie,” she told me as I tried to sleep. “Could you tie me up next time?” I cupped my hand around her left breast and pinched her nipple hard. She made a squeak that was clearly a mix of pain and pleasure. “Shh, Taylor,” I told her. “We’ll talk about that in the morning.” 
Hey, was so excited to get my first pair of Gustin's and they end up coming with a huge hole right in the middle of the butt. Should I contact Gustin first or file a claim with the post office? Any advice is appreciated! Album: 
So, I couldn't stop myself seeing what was possible with the notes we were given for bell choir. Turns out, since we got a dorian scale, things are a bit more complicated than you'd expect. Billie Jean is about the only well known song around that is written in the dorian mode. So, I pulled out a piano arrangement, adapted it to fit for handbells, stripped out all the notes that the Bell Choir can't play, and then started work. Thanks to Arenanet for the awesome minigame that made this possible. Next time, maybe we can get a few more notes? Just throwing it out there... 
Where do you ladies get your relaxed jeans? I have plenty of skinnies, but sometimes I just want some "lazy day" jeans, but I can't seem to find them ANYWHERE. Any advice is helpful. 
wife : Do these jeans make me look fat? Me totally scared: Would you get mad if i tell you the truth? Wife : No, i won't! Tell me. Me : I slept with your sister 
Hi, I'm fairly well off, but I've made it a point to try and live frugally without it really impacting my lifestyle too much. I don't save on food, I eat out regularly, I have drinks and have fun. But I live by a few simple rules that help me maximise savings where possible. You've probably seen many of these before, but I'll share hem regardless. I hope it helps: **[EDIT]** reworded a few things to be more accurate **[EDIT 2]** seems like this thread is taking off a bit and the haters and trolls are out for blood. In no way is this list supposed to be 'a blueprint to saving cash'. It's a list of things that happen to work for *me* in *my situation*. E.g. I don't have a car and am debt free. Take from the list what you think may be useful to you in your situation and discard what you don't. **[EDIT 3]** it seems like #13 is rubbing people the wrong way. I am in no way advocating you go out and blackmail restaurants out of free food. I'm just encouraging you to stand up to businesses who provide sub par service and get your money's worth. Now *shoo* get off your high horse. 1. Payday? Transfer 25% to a savings / investment account. Live off the rest. 2. Use a cashback credit card, but only use it when there's no surcharge (see 14) 3. Use loyalty programs EVERYWHERE. 4. Go grocery shopping with a full stomach to avoid impulse purchases 5. Don't buy mineral water; tap water will do fine (your mileage may vary depending on where you live) 6. Sell what you don't use, eBay is your friend 7. Use public transport off-peak if at all possible 8. Drink from a glass, not from the bottle (also good for portion control) 9. Brand clothing is bullshit; a dark pair of jeans and a plain properly fitting tee will do just fine 10. Do you like to smoke and you can't / don't want to quit? VAPE instead 11. Cold? Wear a sweater. Still cold? Wear a thicker sweater. Still cold? Maybe turn on the heater a bit. 12. Compare insurance. This is huge; you have no idea what you can get just by asking. A simple "competitor X is running promotion Y if I switch, what can you do for me?" can do wonders. 13. Unhappy with a restaurant / experience? Complain, and if they don't respond well, go public on their Facebook page. If you formulate your complaint constructively, you may just get something for free. Use photo evidence where possible. **Edit:** no I don't want you to go out and scam restaurants. For god sake people get of your high horses and learn to interpret. I'm just telling people to stand up against businesses that provide sub par service. 14. **SURCHARGES AND BOOKING FEES ARE CANCER.** Avoid avoid avoid. Switch payment methods if it helps you avoid them. Have cash at hand as well at all times. Online booking fee? Fuck it, call. 15. Dry clothes on a line outside. Only use the dryer when it's raining or extremely humid. Bonus benefit: your clothes will last a bit longer. 16. Re-use stuff. For example, grocery bags as rubbish bags. Paper for note taking. 17. LIGHTS OFF. Very elementary, so easy to forget. ~~18. COMPUTER OFF. Not 'sleep' or any of that bullshit. OFF. **Note /edit**: some say that the spin up from an old hard drive may actually increase your power usage. YOu may want to do a bit of digging, but I'm using an SSD drive without moving parts so in my case this works.~~ *Note: looks like some savvy co-redditors have disproven this as being not very effective. Thanks for the heads up!* 19. Compare utilities (gas, electricity, phone, internet). See 12. 20. If something's half price, buy at least two. Use this to stock up on stuff like toothpaste, shower gel. 21. Don't be afraid to upgrade you phone plan to save. I ended up saving $30 a month by upgrading to a higher data allowance. Bonus for reading through my drivel: - If you get sick and need meds, always ask the pharmacist for a generic. Same stuff, just cheaper. Hope it helps. Feel free to add your own! 
So this is an expansion on [this where /u/anotherthink was asking advice about where to find jeans for us "curvier" shaped ladies. After posting some lame advice I realized I lacked a decent pair of jeans too, so I thought I'd take a day and try to find the perfect pant for pears. *Side note: Pant/jean shopping is a stressful and not-fun situation. I had a martini when I was done with everything.* For many of us, buying jeans that allow plentiful hip/ass/thigh room while contouring to our backsides and waists is a bit difficult. I consider it a more "positive" problem to have, but still, it's really annoying. I decided to test out the most popular suggested lines: **BDG**, **Levi "Curve ID"**, and some generic high rise jeans from any other stores around and find my perfect match. I successfully found **2** pairs of awesome fitting jeans. **Results (FAILS)**: - *Levi's Bold Curve Skinny*: I know my measurements, I used their charts, and holy hell I could not squeeze into even 2 sizes above my normal size. I don't know if their shipments were wrong or if I was in the wrong section, but no success there. I was really excited about that one too. :( - *BDG high-rise*: There were a couple of styles suggested... and as mentioned only the super high rise twig is available. They came pretty close but my booty was still slightly unhappy. I tried some other styles too and still it was a no-go. - *The Gap "Curvy" Jeans*: Just... fail. There was nothing "curvy" about them. - **A close call:***: *Delia's "Liv High Rise Jeggings"*: Delia's pants used to fit me back in the day and I remembered this while passing the store. Unfortunately, I am "woman" sized now and the only available pair in my size was a little tight. Still had some booty room, though. If you're smaller/younger, you may want to check them out. **Results (SUCCESSES!)**: - *NY&amp;Co Curvy Boot Cut*: OMG these jeans. THESE JEANS. I picked out a 10L and they fit so perfectly I did a happy dance in the dressing room. These are by far the most perfect fitting jean I've ever found. I'm actually wearing them right now. Unfortunately boot cut was the only curvy style they had. Hopefully they'll make more... - *Buckle "Culture" and "Harper" style jean*: I had the most fabulous "jean expert" helping me... did you know you can call ahead to Buckle and they'll setup a personal shopping situation for you and ready your dressing room with stuff that fits according to your measurements? Crazy! My jean guy pulled out both styles and I found that the Culture had a little more booty and thigh room than the Harper, but they are very very similar. Culture is a "skinny jean" so now that I had the boot cut, I was happy to purchase a skinny pant as well. **HONORABLE MENTION:** - "Levi's Skinny Perfectly Slimming Pull-On Pants": See I know they aren't jeans but they made a really good, easy, comfortable travel pant and pretty much look like jeans as they go with everything. My booty had room as well as my thighs, and I didn't have to worry about anything showing when I sat down. --- Well, I hope this post helps some of you out. Thanks for reading! :) EDIT: As requested, here are my measurements: 30" waist, 26" thigh, 40/41" hip 
My *skinny* jeans are too loose, but I really love them. So, I went to the same store to get the next size down (12). They were too big! So I tried on a 10. Too tight. I cannot believe I almost fit in a 10. It's been 6 years since I last wore clothes that size. So I didn't buy any jeans, but I did buy some new workout clothes and went on a long bike ride. I'll buy those jeans when they fit perfectly, which should be soon as I am closing in on 40 pounds. Thanks loseit.

Since I buy my clothes for myself I always simply bought jeans that would fit. Since money's tight I want to buy jeans that last me as long as possible. Any suggestions? :) 
Hey y'all. Throwaway because I'm embarrassed by the fact that I'm a careless clutz. I was doing some thrift shopping today and was pretty pleased with my results. A nice Ralph Lauren shirt and a pair of Timberland boots were clutch buys. I finished my tour of the store at a rack full of jeans on the male side of the store. I am fairly skinny so one pair caught my eye as I thought it might fit well. It did! Some parts were a bit tight but I chalked it up to maybe being a trademark thing of Gitano, a brand I hadn't heard of before. Depending on how old you guys are and your awareness of female brands, you might have started laughing by now. PS Gitanos are apparently a line of female jeans from the 80s; this was something I had only discovered at home. So the question now is; are these passable? Or is this going to be one of many losses to the perils of thrifting. [here's an album with fit Edit: Put this in the comments earlier, but wondering if it's really that apparent when the shirt is I won't be wearing these to a date anytime soon, but if you didn't know that these were women's jeans beforehand would you really do a double take on the street? Edit: lol over 18k views. Hopefully nobody recognizes the room. 
Hey guys I am trying to find a place where I can buy highend replica clothing. I fell over this website called Perfectkickz and I saw their stuff and it looked pretty good. I wanna buy a pair of Saint Laurant leather biker jeans and this site is offering it. Does anybody have experience with the website? or if not could you recommend another place to buy them from. I tried Union House on Aliexpress but when I went there the site was shut down.. I am also looking for a pair of replica Christian Louboutin shoes. Who makes the best replicas of those? 
[Former Jeans D:] So for for the year, I'm down 42 lbs. I went on a full blown vegan diet and did a round of insanity. I kind of got lazy over the summer, stopped being vegan, and did insanity only a couple times a week. But now that school is back, I'm back on track and am just as determined since I have my friends back to workout with. =-) I was told it's most apparent in my face. Here's a side by side of myself from this past spring vs now. [Hope you 
In the heat of the Alabama June, I often find myself taking refuge in some of the department stores downtown. I live in a mobile home just south of I-81, and the place is a big, white, piece of shit drowning in other big, white, pieces of shit. My neighborhood is a breeding ground for redneck brothels and meth labs. The trailer I live in supposedly has air-conditioning, evidenced by the gray box hanging from my only window and the extra dough I have to fork up when I pay my rent, but for some reason I continuously find it hard to breathe in my own home. So, in other words, I feel like I'm perfectly justified for wanting to get out of the house as much as possible. I've always meant to get out of this shithole of a town, but I can barely carry my own weight living in a trailer park. I got into my black Ford that is now orange from years of rust and miles of driving on dirt roads. I decided on heading to the Goodwill to pick up some VHS tapes. Even though it's the twenty-first century, the trailer park doesn't have cable (forget about satellite), and I only own a VCR player. So as you can imagine, my sources of entertainment are limited to books and tapes. My friends tell me I'm perpetually living in 1997. I tell them I'm fine with that. My town's Goodwill is crammed between a bakery and fabric store that's missing one of its neon letters. The walk from my car to the front door was excruciating, as I had left my sandals out in the sun and it felt as if I were wearing oily frying pans. My Goodwill is like any other, I suppose. All of the pants in the clothing section smell like their previous owners had never learned what a bath was, the toys were mostly composed of Barbies with missing legs and glassy, white eyes, and the books were eaten away by age, water, and probably earthworms. The movies section, however, that was my prize. They had the usual. Hancock, E.T, Independence Day, Die Hard 2. A surprising amount of Will Smith titles. A few of them made me chuckle. Good Burger. That would be a good one to watch with the guys. About twice a month, my buddies and I sit down, crack open some cold ones, and make fun of movies, MST3K style. One of my friends, Dick, is actually a fan of SNL, and an even bigger Kenan Thompson fan, so I knew Good Burger would be a great movie choice. I snorted just thinking about it. As I picked it off of the shelf, though, I noticed another movie that was trapped in the back of the shelf. I couldn't make out the full title, all I saw were the words "Your Body." Out of curiosity, I tried sliding it out from behind all of the other movies, but I pulled too hard and they all came cascading off the shelf and onto my sandals. I held back a yelp and noticed the teenage store clerk, glaring at me and popping her bubblegum. The "Your Body" film was still in my hand, so I gently laid it to the side and bent over, starting to pick up movies. I stacked them up and slid them all up back on the shelf in no particular order (as if they were in order before). I couldn't find "Good Burger" after that, so I just counted my losses and picked up "Your Body." However, now that I held it in my hand, I noticed that its full title was "Your Body and You!" Upon further inspection, I realized that it was a Sex Ed film from the early 90's. Jackpot. In my head, I did the math: Outdated VHS tape + Uncomfortable child actors + Sex terms like "Testes" = Funny movie. Aside from the title, on the front cover of the tape there was a prepubescent boy and girl, facing away from each other and looking generally shy, all set to a very "Saved by the Bell"-esque backround. It was bright sickening yellow with a bunch of pink and purple triangles and circles. Instead of there being a description on the back, however, there were three snapshots of events that apparently took place in the movie. One was of a clown-like man in white face make-up, ruby red lipstick, a crisply ironed black suit, and outstretched arms. Another was a person with a brown paper bag over their head, surrounded by corn fields. The last was of a person in a purple cardboard robot costume, with their dryer vent arms sticking out in 90 degree angles. These images caught my eye as being very out of place for a Sex Ed film, and the more I looked at the tape, the more it looked homemade. As if it was a home movie and someone just compiled the cover of the tape together in Photoshop. I made my way over the register and handed it to the clerk, who gave me a weird "you're such a perv" look. I paid for it and she asked if I wanted a bag between clicks of her chewing gum. I said no thanks, and I carried it back to my car and drove off. If we're being perfectly honest, I forgot about the tape for the rest of the day. I spent some time looking for clothes that would fit me (I've always been a stress eater; I had been going up a few sizes), and I ate at Chili's for lunch. After spending most of the day downtown, I made my way back down the dirt road and to my trailer. Unloading bags of clothing and a few groceries, I noticed the tape hidden under all of the plastic and I smiled again. This was going to be a fun movie night. I called the guys over, but most of them had work or dates or some other stuff like that. In the end, I decide to postpone movie night to next weekend. But as I picked up "Travels With Charley", my mind flung itself back to the tape. For the second time that day, my curiosity got the better of me. I went outside at 11 o'clock to get an old Sex Ed film from my truck. I know, I'm a creep, but the pictures on the back had peaked my interest. When I got back inside, I turned on the old black TV. It buzzed as I turned on, playing white noise at what seemed like full volume. I scrambled for the remote and turned it down, and then slid the tape out of its cardboard case and into the VCR. It was clear that someone had been watching the film before I had and didn't take the time to rewind it back to the beginning. The tape started in the middle of a song. The singer was the cardboard purple robot from the back of the cover. I hadn't taken a good look at the robot before, but now that I looked at it, I realized how laughably makeshift the costume was. The body and head were made out of two separate cardboard boxes that had been painted purple. It had square eye and mouth holes cut out, but they were covered with black mesh so that you couldn't see who was inside. The arms were made from dryer ventilation, and legs were just purple sweatpants. The person in the costume was doing the robot and singing in a shrill, barely distinguishable voice. I realized it was probably a woman in the costume. I wanted to rewind to the beginning, but I was entranced by the comedic awkwardness of the song. The music was okay, I suppose. It was synth music, and it seemed to be the only professional thing that I was seeing. I can remember a few of the lyrics: "Get up, take off your shoes! "Together, we'll spread the news! "So, your body is turning. "Don't worry, we're all learning, "About the fun times, "And bad times, "of Puberty!" Like I'm saying, it was probably the most cringe-worthy thing I had ever seen. When the song was over, the shot panned to two little kids who couldn't be older than 10. A boy and a girl, the same ones on the cover. They were both sitting on the carpeted floor, and they seemed to be in the middle of a game of Monopoly. They both clapped hesitantly. The shot changed to a closeup of the clown man from the cover of the tape. I nearly jumped out of my seat. He was sweating profusely, and his white makeup was rubbing off, but he didn't seem to care. He grinned with his ruby lips and looked off camera (probably at the robot) and said, "Excellent job, Pubot." I almost laughed at the robot's name. Pubot? But then again, something about the clown rubbed me the wrong way. The way he looked at whatever was off camera like it was a piece of meat, or the deranged twinkle in his black eyes. I don't know. He just creeped me out. Unsettled, I rewound the tape until I no longer heard the faint humming of the VCR and then pressed play. It started with a single synth note that led off into nowhere, and the words appeared on the screen: "Baker Family Productions." And then, of course: "Your Body and You!" It was at this time that I noticed how damaged the tape was. There was the occasional visual tear, but sometimes it went full-out distortion and it was almost unwatchable. The actual film started with the boy and the girl laying on the carpet, playing Monopoly. The shot zoomed out and the clown man walked on screen. The boy and girl reigned surprise. "Who are you?" The boy asked, standing up with the girl. "Why, I'm Pubester, the puberty clown!" The clown man said in a gravelly Krusty The Clown impersonation. The kids didn't laugh at this ridiculous announcement, which surprised me. Pubot jumped on screen. "And I'm Pubot, the puberty robot!" she said. "And together," they said in unison, "We're going to teach you about puberty!" "But what is puberty?" the girl asked. Pubester glared at her. The girl gasped and put her hand over her mouth. Pubot dropped her arms. They all stood in silence. "I'm so sorry, daddy," the girl said, wincing. Pubester lost it. "CUT! FUCKING CUT! SHE ALWAYS FUCKS UP HER LINES, BETTY. FUCKING ALWAYS." He turned to the girl. "WHY CAN'T YOU BE MORE LIKE YOUR BROTHER?" The girl tried to apologize again. "FUCKING SAVE IT. IF YOU FUCK UP AGAIN, YOU CAN SLEEP OUT IN THE GODDAMN RAIN." Pubester and Pubot walked off screen, and the boy and the girl sat down at the board game again. The girl wiped her eyes with her sweater. "ACTION!" And so they did the same scene again, me with my mouth gaping open. When it came to the part where the girl messed up, she stayed silent and the boy said, "But what is puberty?" And Pubot answered. "Puberty is when your body goes through the changes that make you an adult." Pubester smiled, his lips gleaming. "That's right, Pubot, and we're here to help these kids understand their transition from children to adults." After a little bit of silence, Pubester ran over to the camera. "Alright, cut. Was that so hard, Tabitha?" Emotionless, the girl shook her head. The boy stared at the floor. Pubester moved the camera to the side so Pubot took up the whole screen. "Alright, honey. Sing the song. Just like we rehearsed it." After Pubester said action, Pubot started singing that horrible song. I fast fowarded, still in shock from what I just saw. Pubot finished the song, and the shot changed back to the close up of Pubester. This was strange, as the film seemed generally unedited, but there were still cuts here and there. Pubester appeared to be the Director, and he didn't seem to be what my parents would call "all there." Perhaps he forgot to edit the film before it was distributed. After Pubester finished his line, he said something without breaking eye contact with whatever was off camera. "Alright, Betty, move the camera to the kids." The camera shifted to the boy and Tabitha squeakily, and the clown said, "Action!" "Gee, that was a great song!" the boy exclaimed. "Yeah, it was spectacular," Tabitha said in a monotone voice. Pubot started to say something, but Pubester stopped her. "No, Betty," he said, raising a gloved hand. His voice was strained, as if he struggled to keep his temper under control. "We're done for today. Tabitha needs some timeout so she can reflect on her lack of acting." Tears welled in Tabitha's eyes. "No, Daddy! I'll do better next ti-" The shot changed to someone walking up the stairs. They had the camera in their hand, and I couldn't see who it was. They turned on the kitchen light, and walked over to the window. I could hear the rain pittering on the roof, and when the camera man set the camera facing out the window, I saw how dark it was outside. They turned on the porch light, and outside I could see that the house was out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by acres of cornfields. The front yard had a single baby tree and a dirt road stretching out for miles. But as the camera adjusted to the new light source and got less blurry, I noticed something attached to the tree. There was a flash of lightning, and for a split second, I saw it perfectly clear. Tabitha was chained by her legs to the tree, face first in the mud. Her back was heaving up and down, as if she were hyperventilating. The rain slapped the back of her neck, and her hands covered her head. Suddenly, someone started speaking. Their voice was crisp and crackily; they were probably speaking right next to the camera's microphone. "Consider this a lesson to bad actors, Tabby. Be more expressive or else you get to sleep out in the rain." The shot changed to a man in his kitchen, frying bacon. It was Pubester, only he wasn't wearing his makeup or suit. He was an average looking guy, with some stubble and a bath robe on. The sun shone through the kitchen window brightly, and the bacon sizzled and popped. Pubester was humming the puberty song that Pubot had sung the night before. The camera was probably set up in some cupboard, as I could see the whole kitchen. A woman with bedraggled hair and a white tank top stumbled in and turned on the coffee maker. "How did you sleep last night, honey?" Pubester asked, making Sunday morning small talk. It dawned on me that this woman, Betty, was Pubester's wife and was probably Pubot. Betty almost said something, but then her eyes were caught by something out the window. "OH MY GOD!" She screamed, running frantically out of the screen door. Pubester smiled to himself, flipping a few slices of bacon. About thirty seconds later, the screen door flung open, with Betty carrying Tabitha in her arms. The girl was soaking wet, and her face was a pale white color, as if she had been dressed up for her own funeral. Her eyes remained closed and her damp, matted hair hung from her scalp like wet noodles. Betty laid her down on the kitchen's tiled floor, putting her lips on her daughters in an ignorant kind of attempt at CPR. This, however, was unneeded, as the girls stomach was still heaving up and down just like it had been the night before, something Betty failed to notice. Tabitha was still alive. Pubester turned around and grinned at Betty, his hands clutching the counter behind him. "I let you say shit to my kids, Charlie," Betty gasped between pathetic necessitations, "But this time, you've gone too fucking far!" Charlie stayed silent, looking at his wife like she was an ant trying to escape a swimming pool. The smile stayed on his face, but it was only what I can describe as a fake smile. The kind that news anchors use when they want to seem charismatic. The kind of mask that only a sick, demented, shell of a person would wear. He stopped leaning against the counter and approached his wife, slightly bending over as he walked, as if she were a small child. "I was honestly hoping you'd say something like that," he said, kicking his wife in shoulder. She fell to the ground, grasping where she had been kicked. She was about to scream something like, "CHARLIE, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?" Until she noticed him digging around in the knife drawer. And even though it had been filmed on a shitty household camera, I could still see the terror form in her eyes. The way her expression had gone from infuriated to scared in just an instant. Despite the pain in her shoulder and her daughter laying unconscious on the floor, Betty scrambled to her feet and out the screen door. Charlie was in no rush; he found the particular knife he was looking for, stepped over his daughter, and walked briskly out the door. After a few seconds, I could hear him faintly in the distance: "THERE'S CORNFIELDS FOR MILES OUT HERE." For minutes, I stared deeply into my television screen, waiting for something to happen. I nearly jumped when the little boy walked into the kitchen in his onesie pajamas and pulled himself into his seat. He saw his sister laying cold on the floor, but he didn't say anything, or even look at her. It was as if he were trained not to speak up. Part of me wanted to fast forward, but I was overcome with a sudden empathy for the kid. His stomach audibly growled, but he didn't do anything about it. He just sat there, still as a statue, awaiting further instruction. Minutes passed, and Charlie returned, his bathrobe sopping wet from the last night's rain. His knife was gone. Ignoring his son, Charlie picked up Tabitha's body, and carried her further into the house off camera. He returned and made himself a cup of coffee. Drinking it black, he walked over to his son and ruffled his hair. The final scene of Your Body and You was probably the reason I chose to burn it. It wasn't for a religious reason or anything, or even for censorship. I've always firmly believed in the pursuit of knowledge. But there are some things the world would be better off from seeing. The final scene was the same one depicted on the back of the tape; a girl with a paper bag over her head surrounded by cornfields. Her golden yellow hair twirled down from under her bag and onto her shoulders. She was moving amongst the cornfields, speeding quickly through the yellow stalks. It didn't take me long to figure out that she was in the back of a truck. The girl sat as still as a statue, despite the fact that she was in the back of a speeding pickup. After minutes of the same continuous shot, the truck slowly glided to a halt. I heard the driver's door open and then slam shut. Charlie walked into frame, looking pissed off. He opened the back of the pickup and grabbed the girl by the wrists, then dragged her out of the back and into the dirt. I half-expected her to kick and scream, but she stayed still, only slightly wincing when she hit the ground. Charlie sat her up and pulled some rope out of his jean pocket. The sun beat down on them both, as he tied her hands behind her back and forced her to stand up. He walked over to the trunk and unscrewed the camera from its tripod. Grabbing her by the wrists, Charlie began to lead her into the cornfields while carrying the camera. The stalks brushed by them as they walked. The more they moved, the more I could make out a small clearing in the distance where a couple of stalks had been pushed down. They made their way to it, and I felt a dropping sensation in my stomach. As if I had just fallen off of a skyscraper and was just seconds from hitting the ground. Charlie pushed his way into the clearing. Inside was Betty, laying face down in a puddle of dried up blood. It had crusted into the soil, making it reddish brown. Charlie forced the girl with the bag on her head to her knees. At this point, her shoulders started moving up and down, and her chest shuddered. Even though the bag blocked her face, I knew she was sobbing. She knew where she was, and she knew what had happened to her mother. Instead of saying anything, Charlie sat in the dirt with his daughter, still pointing the camera at her. "Tabby, when was the last time Mommy took you to Sunday School?" Charlie asked. Inhaling deeply as she spoke, Tabitha said, "I don't know." Charlie didn't say anything immediately, but I knew he was smirking behind the camera. "When I was your age, my Mama had me and my brothers walking to Church every Sunday morning." Tabitha sniffled. "I never really bought into it myself, the whole 'Jesus loves you' thing. Besides, if he really loved you, do you really think you'd be sitting in the dirt in the middle of nowhere next to me?" Tabitha shook her head under the paper bag. Charlie continued, "My Mama was a very strict Christian lady. However, she didn't always agree with everything that the good book said." "She always said that she never believed that the Devil was a snake or a fallen angel. In fact, she believed that the Devil lived out here in Nebraska, eating from people's cornfields and making men beat their wives." "Whenever I asked her if I could go out and play in the fields, she always warned me that if I should come across Satan himself, I shouldn't look him directly in the eyes. I should drop to the ground, cover my head, and call for help." "She spoke about him as if she had met him once." "I never came face-to-face with the Devil. Never directly, anyway." Charlie got up and dusted off his pant legs. "Mama always said that the Devil could twist a man's will. Turn a martyr into a murderer." "I suppose she was always right about that one." The tape ended there. The screen turned blue, and a single word appeared on the bottom left corner. Stop. Was this the end? How could it be? What happened to Tabitha? The boy? It eventually crossed my mind to do research on the matter. Like I said, Internet was not an option in my neighborhood. I must have wasted a quarter of my rent money on driving to the nearest library. When I pulled up, I walked inside the glass sliding doors. Mmm... Air conditioning. A luxury I had never been able to afford. The elderly woman at the front desk asked if she could help me. I asked if I could use one of her computers. She said yes, as long as I had a membership, which I did not. I paid a couple of bucks for the registration process, received my username and password, and then sat down at one of the monstrous white computers. The library was almost deserted; the only other people were the librarian and a fat guy drooling over the graphic novel selection. I logged in and opened Chrome. Unsure of what to search, I typed in "Your Body and You!" I clicked through a couple of pages of search results, turning up nothing of interest. Just a bunch of .gov pages. Scrolling back up to the search bar, I typed in "Charlie Baker." It turned up with the Wikipedia page of Charlie Baker, the Republican Governor of Massachusetts. Dead End. Scrolling back up, I typed in "Baker Family Productions." Surprisingly, there are a lot of Baker Families out there that produce things. Gospel music bands, homemade films, even canned goods. However, after scrolling through a couple of pages, I found a single thread on some backwater gore fanatic forum entitled "The Charlie Baker Murders." Reading the thread, I saw that it was started by someone like me who discovered one of Charlie's VHS tapes, only the one he saw wasn't "Your Body and You!" it was a film called "Everett's Big Day." People on the forum were interested by the movie, as it was also unedited and showed Charlie Baker's general abuse to his wife and children. They dug deeper, and through public record and several deleted Wikipedia articles, they uncovered more and more about who Charlie Baker was. Charlie Baker was born just on the outskirts of Monowi, Nebraska. The town was small back then, but now it has a population of just one: Elsie Eiler. The town is now the smallest in Nebraska, and by extension, the United States. Charlie grew up with only one parent and four brothers, and when he was a teenager he got a job at a nearby Corn Mill, which he kept until his later adult life. As he grew up, Charlie spent increasingly more time at Monowi's Tavern, which was owned by Mrs. Eiler. Eiler was not only the mayor of the town, but also the owner of the library and tavern. And it was at this tavern that Charlie would meet Betty Scaggs, a single mother who lived in an old farmhouse in the middle of a bunch of overgrown cornfields. They quickly built a relationship and got married, and Charlie moved into Betty's house. However, as time passed, Charlie got more and more irritable and aggressive. He lost his job at the Corn Mill as he would constantly get into fights with his coworkers, and he was deemed too dangerous to be around heavy machinery. It was at this point that Charlie bought a camera. At first, he filmed things just to document. He'd take the camera with him when he went for rides, or to the general store, or basically anywhere. Eventually Charlie decided to make movies. His wife was worried about how they were going to feed the kids, but she was also terrified of what Charlie would do when he snapped, so she humored him. The local police found Betty and Tabitha dead in a cornfield; Betty from knife wounds, Tabitha from dehydration. Charlie was gone. After a couple of months, they found the body of Everett, Betty's son, stuffed inside of the house's sewage tank. His body reeked of shit and blood. His skin had started to peel off from weeks of corrosion. Together, the Baker Family made over a dozen feature-length films, however only four of them were discovered by the forum users. "Your Body and You!" was the final uncovered film by Charlie Baker, as far as I can tell. None of the forum users had discovered it yet, and the thread hadn't been updated since 2010. And so I burned it. The world doesn't need another Charlie Baker. The final post on the thread was by a user called "Rematrib." He was a Nebraska resident who was intrigued by the whole thing, so he took a trip down to Monowi and managed to get an interview with Elsie Eiler. Her husband had died in 2004, making her the only resident left in the town. He sat down with her in the Monowi tavern and asked about Charlie Baker. "Oh, him," she said distastefully. "I was friends with his Mama, you know. He was always such a sweet boy. I can't imagine why someone so nice could go and do something like that." "There must be some reason why," Rematrib told her. Elsie sighed. "You know, when he was a boy, he would come into my shop with his brothers and tell me about his day. I would give them a small order of fries and sit down and listen to them." "It was the usual kind of thing a little boy would talk about. Who shot who when they were playing cowboys, who got stung by the most bees, and so on." "However, every once in a while, Charlie would tell me that he saw the Devil out in the cornfields when he got separated from the rest of the boys." 
Below is my recounting of AC2015. I posted this elsewhere and it's tailored for a different community but I figured maybe it'd be welcome here too. Someone on twitter wanted me to post it here on reddit. Also you better not upvote this cus if it goes over 50 I gotta eat Pink. Anthrocon 2015 was a thing I attended. I had a lot of fun. I also had a lot of very jarring, strange to downright disgusting experiences. This is just me talking about what happened to try work out for myself where I belong in the furry community, if at all, and if the good of AC outweighed the negative. Input is appreciated. AC2015 was always a litmus test for me. I've been on the outskirts of furry for about 8 years. My main interest has always been fursuiting. 3 years ago I made first contact with another furry. 1 year ago I attended a local meet up... Briefly before leaving and cutting ties. In the past few months I got my first fursuit to share with a few close friends and my boyfriend. At AC2015 I'd share it with the world. I was excited but also scared. I'm going to make points about my experience in no particular order. Just as they come to me. Some positive, some neutral, some negative. 1: The community and quality of people at AC is far better than that of any local meet I've been to. Every single furry stereotype imaginable congregates at furmeets. From the obnoxiously loud underage kids to the unhygienic, possibly mentally handicapped man in animal ears playing his 3DS and refusing to socialize. The organizer lady of the event tried her best to rope things together but it was useless. I felt sorry for her. I offered my friend a ride home – 2 others overheard and demanded a ride. “Sorry, my car only has two seats. It's an S2000” I lied, walking outside and to the side of the cafe to get in my Subaru Forester. Yet AC was a lot better. My theories to why follow; One: Attending AC requires money. Money is acquired from jobs. If you're too unhygienic or generally socially awkward and unacceptable by societies most basic standards, you can't hold a job. If you can't hold a job, you can't go to AC. This cuts out MOST of the weirdos that attend local meets. Supporting this theory was a rather portly gentleman that sat next to me on the con shuttle. His smell pungent, fursuit scraggly and general aura unpleasant. “Where are you from?” I ask to change the subject from his attraction to Minerva Mink. “Right here in Pittsburgh baby!” he responds, attempting to put an arm around me which I promptly deny. Well then, no need to pay for a plane ticket or hotel for him. Two: Uncle Kage runs a tight ship. If you can't follow simple rules, are an ultra negative image for furry or are simply batshit insane, you get banned. Case in point, [redacted1] and [redacted2]. While it's literally censoring the fandom, knowing characters like [redacted1] wouldn't be attending if Uncle Kage had a choice made me much more comfortable and safer. I hope uncle Kage learns about the antics of people like [redacted3] sooner rather than later. Those two things limit how many, um... “Undesirables” get through. I imagine many will feel offended by what I just said. I know I'll get flak for it. But judging people by their impression on me and how they carry myself has kept me on a good track for over 20 years. It's a tried and true formula that shaves off crowds I want no part of. 2: On day one people looked at me and stared at me, a member of con security locking eyes with me for uncomfortably long. Later that day a man in an orange fox hoodie asked me if I was a furry. “Of course I am, why else would I be here?” I respond. “But you looks so posh! You sure you're not with NPR or something?” he laughs, trotting off. I thought about what he said when I got back to my hotel room, looking at myself in the mirror. Before me was an average-sized man wearing a short sleeve button up shirt, fitted jeans with no stains or holes, semi-formal slip on black shoes, a cleanly-shaven face and well kept haircut, with clean rectangular grey-metal glasses sitting on his nose. I considered what everyone else wore that day. In my usual dress I was odd, alien even. That night I purchased some brown sneakers and baggy jeans from downtown, wearing them and my con shirt to the next day. From then on I was invisible. 3: The convention is extremely two faced. “We're just a group of people that love cartoon animals!” Kage tells eager reporters, hours before running a panel where he tells furrys how to interact with the media. The next day I go around the dealers room – one of the few places I never saw a news team. The first thing I see directly ahead of me in the middle of the dealers room floor is a large stand for Furoticon – a furry Magic: The Gathering clone where everything is about sex. Nearby is a place to get fitted for a custom collar or bondage cuffs. Across the hall is a second collar store specializing in latex/rubber collars. There's also a place to get a full body harness. The majority of artists in the alley have 18+ binders – one has three 18+ binders on his table and nothing more apart from his artist name on a hastily made plaque. Kage deflects all accusations that Anthrocon is a sex thing whenever asked he says in his aforementioned panel, but never denies. You should too, he says. Yet most dealer tables have something sex related for sale, whether it be books, collars or otherwise. Its clear that he knows about this stuff, and denying it for the sake of the con. Pittsburgh is shockingly Christian – numerous churches, preachers in the street, and on Sunday everything is closed. While I appreciate Kages efforts for the facade, I can clearly see why he does it, but it made the experience utterly jarring. I'd be more comfortable if he was more honest with the city about why furries attend, but we all know that would terminate ACs stay in Pittsburgh permanently. 4: The obsession with the famous was astounding. I briefly got to see 2 the Ranting Gryphon. We stayed in the same hotel, we did nothing more then glance at each other. I told someone about this and they pressured me on why I didn't ask for a autograph, or even say “hi”. “I don't really care for him. Never seen any of his material” I say, their jaw dropping. “But he's so big! I'm so jealous, you just wasted a huge opportunity!” I shrugged it off. Every time I saw Kage he had an entourage of people, some obviously his friends, others orbiting the group, eager to become his friends. They sweat and breath heavily, waiting for the perfect moment to spring their rehearsed joke or comment that'll surely win his heart and their own seat in the world of furry fame. I interacted with Kage briefly once, threatening him with an umbrella. My other instance with a famous furry was in the headless lounge. I sat on a chair, fursuit head on a fan to air it out. The lounge has around 6~ people total, casually talking about everything from their suits to the weather. Telephone walks in, removing her suit head and setting it down. Conversation stops, everyone looks, some look at me and each other as if assessing whether they should make a move. Seconds later conversation returns, quieter this time, the topic obvious. 5: People are there to fuck. And that's OK. My fursuit it cute, feminine and attracted a lot of unwanted attention of people that wanted to fuck it. That's not OK. On the day before As in the Westin Lobby someone placed their palm on the suits chest, I swat it away. “Whats wrong? I thought you'd like that sort of thing... Did I so something wrong?” the tall man says, getting quieter with each utterance before blushing deep red and going away. He avoids eye contact with me from then on. On the final day I emerged from the headless lounge, and as I adjusted my head a man in his 40s puts an arm around me. “Hey there, lets get a picture!” I oblige. “Doing anything? Me and my buddies are going to my room for drinks, if you dig.” His inflection and hand slipping from my hip to my rear reveals his intentions go far beyond just drinks. “Want in?” I refuse, shaking my head as I jog away quickly. I wonder what he was going to do with my picture. Other than those two instances, numerous referenced to my suit as “sexy”. Not cute, not pretty, but “sexy”. It made me wary of them. Their first instance upon seeing me was not “cute dog!” but “wow, they're sexy!” and they didn’t even try to hide it. It really made me feel gross and put me off suiting. 6: Some panels were good. Some were kinda bad. My least favourite was “whos lion is it anyway”. While the comedy was good the presenter spent a LOT of time promoting himself, the convention he runs and his friends. The first round was nearly exclusively his friends. It took at least half an hour to set up party quirks, and the actual time spent on it far less. The round after was a logistical nightmare, at least 50 people on stage in 3 rows. For someone that runs a con, he should consider how to streamline his panel a bit more to be more comedy, and less promotion and rules-explanation. 7: The best experiences were the out of panel ones. Playing Joust for 2 hours with friends and random folk. Posing for hundreds and hundreds of pictures with not only con attendees but the people of Pittsburgh. Picking up and carrying midget fursuiters (while in suit myself) for 20 minutes at a time because why not. Hugging fursuiters. Highfiving them. Causing mischief like a 10 yearold with his first water pistol. Meeting some great people in the headless lounge and exchanging fursuiting tips and care guides. Sampling local brews out and about or in peoples rooms. Meeting with a group of fellow misfits and becoming best friends. If you go to AC for the panels, you're doing it wrong. 8: People in murrsuits posing with children for photos. People in fursuits with dick holes in them that they have had sex in. Posing for photos. With children that are like, 8. Wearing con badges with their internet handles on, that Googling will result in fursuit porn. The kids and parents may find the shorts or y-fronts cute, but we the con attendees all know whats under there. And we're all silently judging you and gossiping about you. Seriously, its gross. Just say “no thanks” jeeze. If you're reading this know who you are. 9: Fursuiting is a great anonymity experience. I'm very shy about my face and identity around furries – becoming my fursuits character for a solid 4 days around strangers was intriguing. Great. Amazing even. People see you as an exciting, multi-dimensional bouncy character, and not the slouching human hiding behind the suit. So that's that. All major things that happened to me at AC. Other things were comparatively inconsequential or unrelated. I'm still unsure what to make of AC. Did I enjoy it? What do I make of my experiences? If I go again, what will I do differently? I think about that a lot lately, slouched on my deck, thinking about my fursuit and what it means to me, what it means to furries and how those two ideologies differed. To me it's a disguise, a character I become to attend furry functions without anyone knowing who I am, but it's a character I love being. One that's outgoing, playful and sassy, yet at times shy. Shy like me, my own personality bleeding in to the fur and foam facade that I once differentiated from myself, but now compare myself to. I wonder if fursuiting affects my own character, and if so if its a positive or negative one. I wonder how the furry fandom molds my personality, and if that's a good thing at all. EDIT: Removed names. 
For me personally it's jeans. For instance if I can tell he is wearing cheap jeans it bothers me. Yeah it is shallow.

Pt. II can be read I am a female in my late 20s who lives alone. I have a small ground floor flat with a garden and an outlook onto fields to the rear – the perfect haven for my cat to explore, though I’ve often felt uneasy about security to the rear of my property. For context, [this is what my rear garden looks like in I have a cat flap on my back door to allow Stinky to roam as she pleases, rather than have her cooped up alone while I'm at work. This cat flap, which I installed as a matter of convenience, has become the catalyst for a six-month chain of nightmarish events. It began in January, when I returned home from a late shift. It was close to 1am and pitch dark, and I was desperate to get into my bed. But as I pulled up in front of the flat, I spotted something that made my heart lurch. There was a man crouched at my front door, his hand through my letterbox. As I switched off my ignition, he spotted me and began to walk towards my car. God knows why – adrenalin, tiredness, sheer idiocy – instead of locking my door and staying put, I got out of the car and met him mid-way. ‘Can I help you with something?’ I asked. He was fairly nondescript, roughly my age or a little older, wearing dark jeans and a heavy duffel coat. ‘You own a grey cat, don’t you? I’m really sorry, but I found it injured by my door earlier this evening. It’s at my house along the street here if you want to collect it.’ I felt sick to my stomach. I’m not a crazy cat lady, but this little bugger’s been my best pal for the past three years, and the thought of her injured made my blood run cold. I didn’t stop to wonder why he was still trying my door at 1am if he had found her ‘earlier’ nor did I stop to consider I had never seen him before. I thanked him profusely for letting me know and asked if he could wait a moment till I went inside to collect her carry case. ‘Why do you need a case? I have it wrapped in a towel. Just come get it now. It’s late.’ I was surprised by how agitated he suddenly seemed. ‘If she’s hurt, it’s best for me to put her in her case, where she’ll be safe. If I try to carry her in a towel she might wriggle away,’ I responded, confused by his attitude. ‘No, we don’t have time. Just come on.’ He was practically hopping from foot-to-foot now, and made a move to take me by the elbow. I side-stepped him and walked to my door, keeping my eye on him. ‘I really appreciate you taking her in, but please just let me grab this case. I’ll be 30 seconds,’ I said, putting my key in the lock. As I swung open my door, he lunged towards me. Completely taken aback, I acted on sheer reflex and swung my elbow up into his face. Stunned by the impact, he staggered back, allowing me just enough time to slam the door shut and turn the lock. He furiously pounded on the door and attempted to stick his hand through the letterbox, presumably trying to reach the key/handle from there. Again, sheer instinct made me slash the rough edge of the key across the back of his fist, and he withdrew it immediately, cursing at me all the while. I stood inside the door, completely stunned and confused. When Stinky herself suddenly appeared at my feet and twined herself around my legs, clearly right as rain, it dawned on me that I had almost stepped into some sort of lure. The letterbox opened once more, but this time he leaned his face into it and whispered something that made every hair on my body stand on end: ‘I’ll come round the back way, then. You do know that cat flaps aren’t very safe, don’t you?’ Sheer terror overtook me as I imaged his arm reaching in that flap… I sped to the back door and dragged my dining table in front of it as quickly as I could. Within seconds, his face appeared in the glass panel. He looked maniacal, to say the least. The whites of his eyes stood out starkly in the dark, and he was panting excitedly. ‘JaneDoeThrowaway28, let me in.’ Well, fucking shitballs, he knew my name. He slid down the door and started to nudge open the cat flap with his arm. I was by now a whimpering wreck, kicking ineffectually at the door and desperately trying to dial 999 on my mobile at the same time. 'JaneDoeThroaway28, I will get in. We're going to be spending some time together.' Well, reader, did my best pal let me down? No, she did not. Spotting his arm snaking through her cat flap, she naturally assumed it was a game, and pounced on him, her claws raking his bare skin. She sunk her teeth into the fleshy part of his forearm and began to kick furiously, her claws inflicting more damage. He cursed and withdrew, standing up to glare at me through the glass. ‘Emergency services, how may I direct your call?’ I sagged in relief as I was connected to the police. Hearing my conversation, he gave me one last meaningful look, and disappeared. The police arrived promptly. The officers who took my statement were kind and did a lot to calm me down, telling me that though I shouldn’t have engaged him at all, I had done the correct thing when I became suspicious. They tried to play down the fact that he knew my name, pointing out that I had my work’s ID lanyard around my neck with my name clearly visible. ‘We’re sure he won’t be back, but we’ll put a patrol outside for the next few nights, while you’re on late finishes. You might want to ask a friend or family member to stay with you.’ My boyfriend stayed with me for the next few nights, and for a week or so I thought they were right – this was just a one-off experience with an opportunistic arse who had spotted the cat flap and concocted a story accordingly. Of course, I wouldn't be here if that was the end of it all. As this post is already quite long, I will continue tomorrow, should anyone like to know how my stalker upped the ante in later weeks. 
I was originally going to post this as a comment to a story in petty about the inappropriate use of a roommate's kitchen utensils, but as I wrote it out, I realized it bit too severe for pettyrevenge. I had a roommate in college who was a nightmare. She always tore up my dishes, my pots and pans, used my shampoo, wore my jeans- never asked permission, just walked into my room and took whatever she wanted. She had nothing of her own, I swear. My pots were just parts of a cheap set from Target, but they were all I had. The last straw was when she ruined one heating it up with nothing in it (Why? The world may never know.) I put all the pots and pans in my bedroom and kept my door locked after that. I also banned her from touching anything I owned or had purchased. I resorted to petty shit like "these are my eggs" and "that is my remote." I was young and entirely too salty for my own good, I will openly admit. She was so upset after a week of being denied part ownership of my things that she ended up insisting that I move out. Bold move, Honcho, considering it was my name on the lease, not hers, and I had been letting her live with me without putting her name on the lease. *And* "we" had another two months on "our" lease. But ok, fine, sounds great to me, Bubbles! So I went to the landlord and informed him I wanted out of my lease. He was used to students bopping in and out -college town-, and he said as long as I could find a sublessor and give up my deposit to that person, I could leave early. Naturally, he didn't know (or probably care- they were seedy college apartments) that I had an illegitimate roommate who wasn't on my lease. Guess who got a new roommate curtesy of Craigslist, exactly two days later? Not me! I couch-surfed with a friend across town until getting a better job and my own apartment. This sounds harsh for a burnt pan, but earlier in the year my dog bit her. He nipped her hand; there was no broken skin, just one hell of a bruise. He nipped her hand because he was in my room and she came in on her own accord when I was not home and reached over him, and the threshold to my door, to open my dresser. I had a baby gate blocking him in my room, so she had to admit that's what had happened, but said she needed "her necklace" that was mysteriously in my room. Her parents bullied 20 year-old-me into giving him away because I was young and scared of getting in trouble. I was paying my own rent and needed her half. I ended up agreeing to give the dog away to a friend. The whole ordeal was terrible. Shortly after that, she got a cat. I think the whole thing was a set-up so she could get a cat without my dog trying to eat it. Back to the Chinese roommate. Guy found my ad, said he and his wife would take it, and they were at the door to the leasing office to sign papers that next day. She was livid. Her parents were livid. She had told them she was on the lease, and they had been paying for half the rent, so the sudden realization that she was lying and that she had nowhere to live was a bit exciting for everyone involved on that end. But there was nothing they could do- it was my apartment and I had the right to sub-let it, as she was not on the lease. Bitch, don't use my pans. I would like to note that I have mellowed quite a bit in the past several years. I also lived alone after that until I met my husband five years later, so maybe that helped. I never apologized for forcing her to live with a random Chinese man and his wife, though. And I have no idea how long she was still there with them until she moved- he had the right to kick her out. I assume he did. So Maggie, I'm sorry I possibly forced brief homelessness upon you when we were sophomores in college. Also, fuck your cat. TL;DR Bitch, don't use my pans. 
*“Anyway, there is one thing I have learned and that is not to dress uncomfortably, in styles which hurt: winklepicker shoes that cripple your feet and tight pants that squash your balls. Indian clothes are better.” ? George Harrison* OK, so until we all move to India to lift, jeans are going to suck to buy. Yes you can search everywhere to find those pants that snuggle your quads and ass in just the right way, and then get the calves/waist taken in because you have the ass of a Grecian hero and the quads of a horse, but that also requires putting your new best friends in the hands of a tailor you trust. This is a question that gets asked often enough, and our anti-advertising rule sometimes bites us in the ass and we miss out on some cool shit. So here's the megathread that we can point anyone to the next time, to either add their own opinion on jeans, or advertisers can respond in the appropriate place. ###THREAD RULES: 1.

This story actually happened about 6 years ago. My sincerest apologies for the length of this story, as I am verbose and often include too many details. But I think reddit might enjoy this. It was a sunny warm Sunday and I had been hunting for the recently released G1 Android phone on Craigslist. After emailing back and forth a few times, we arrived at a great price for not one but 2 phones! So, we arranged to meet at an apartment complex about 30 minutes away. I gathered my cash and drove to the location. I was stupid and young at the time, and did not comprehend how dangerous the part of town I was heading into was. But, I felt relatively safe upon arrival since it was a pretty well populated apartment complex and there were lots of people around in broad daylight. I was standing on the sidewalk in between the parking lot and the pool area, where a bunch of kids were playing, swimming, shooting each other with water guns, etc. Parents were all around watching. Even so, I had folded up all the money and stuffed it in an almost empty pack of cigarettes. I was wearing jeans, a t shirt, a gray hoodie with two pockets on the front, flip flops, and glasses. I put the cigarette money pack in my left hoodie pocket and I had a switchblade in my right hand in the other pocket. (Hey, it seemed safe enough, but I was being cautious- or so I thought.) So, the seller comes out, shes a 20 something girl, and shows me the phone. I have a look, agree to the purchase, and she says she needs to go back up to the apartment to get the other phone and cables. She asks me to come up to the room with her, and I decline (haha! I am so smart!) and respond, "That's ok, I'll wait here." She comes back down another time to apologize that its taking so long, and goes back up to get the rest of the stuff. I'm standing around, happy as can be, when she comes back again and starts talking. I can't even remember what she said because this is when shit got real. Like, real real. As in time slowed down and I entered an alternate reality where this was happening to someone else and not me. She's blabbing about something and suddenly I feel wetness on the right side of my face. I sort of laugh, thinking one of the many children has got me with their water pistol! Ho ho! Well played, little sir! Then I notice that the area, once full of playing children, was completely empty. Not a soul to be seen. My brow furrows as my synapses fire at previously inexperienced speeds to try and orient myself. I notice that the wetness feels oily. My eyes go back to the girl, and I notice that she has stopped talking. Then she bolts. I look to my right, the direction of the blast, and see a skinny man, crouched very low, scuttle around a parked car. Confusion intensifies. Then I see a shadow to my left. I turn just in time to catch a glimpse of a very large man charging at me, who immediately lands a Mayweather magnitude right hook on my left temple. I go down. Hard. My sandals fly off, my glasses are ejected, and my arms go flailing as I hit the rough asphalt of the parking lot. It is at this point that I realize that the wetness was mace, or pepper spray, or whatever you want to call it. It drips into my eyes, my mouth, my nose, its all over my hands, and its pretty much all over my face now. The burning begins, the scorching searing pain of Mount Doom tearing at my flesh and mucous membranes. The pain is over whelming. I am trembling with adrenaline, even as I write this, 6 years later. No sooner than I stop skidding on the asphalt does my large assailant reappear, now kicking me in the ribs, and punching me mercilessly, left right left right left right. He's screaming, "GIVE ME THE MONEY! GIVE ME THE MONEY BITCH." I yelp like a little girl, desperate for any intervention or even acknowledgement of what is happening. I remember my mother always telling me that in her rape defense courses they taught her to yell "FIRE" and not "RAPE" as people are more likely to come to your aid. So, naturally, I yelled everything. "FIRE! RAPE! HELP! STOP! NO! FIRE AGAIN!" but it was in vain. I am no greedy person, and my life was not worth whatever money I had brought, and so I quickly decide to offer it up. But when I reached into the pocket to get the cigarette pack with the money in it, I found nothing but lint. Struggling to squint through the searing pain, my eyes darted around, but I couldn't find it, as I was doubly blind without my glasses. "I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY!" I began to yell, between the blows. But he was not having it. "I KNOW YOU HAVE MONEY," he retorted. And so I desperately rolled over and said, "TAKE MY WALLET I DONT HAVE IT JUST TAKE IT." And take it he did. He rifled through my left jeans pocket and took my shitty flip phone, and then grabbed the back pocket of my jeans, which contained my wallet, and ripped the entire pocket off my jeans. This ripped a huge flap out of the jeans, almost all the way down the leg, exposing my nearly bare ass as I curled into the fetal position on the ground. But the blows did not cease. Rolled over onto my right side as I was, my right hand found its way into my right hoodie pocket. My hand gripped tight around the switchblade. I didn't even think twice about what I was about to do, and in retrospect it could have ended a lot worse. I rolled back to my left, and as my arm came out from under me I flipped the knife open and began waving and jabbing and tearing the space immediately around me into little ribbons. I was blind, so my eyes were jammed shut, which meant I had no direction in my attack. I resorted to attempting to appear as insane as possible, and began shouting like a mad person. Obscenities, sounds, animal noises, anything. And it worked. All I remember hearing was "oh shit" and then the hurried footsteps of that asshole running away. I stopped my targetless attack, and drug myself to my hands and knees. I had to get out of there. I found my glasses, cracked and scratched, close by. I struggled to get them on and feebly collected my keys and one flip flop when I looked up and saw it: about a foot under the back of my parked car laid the cigarette case containing the object of the assault. Somehow, the irony of the situation gave me strength, and I collected my money. I stood up and shouted, angry with the world. "FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU ALL!" and jumped in the car. I had no phone, and obviously nobody was going to help me, so I got the fuck out of there. I drove. A few miles. Nearly blind. As I sat at a stop light, shaking, my mind began to assemble the facts. This was a setup. There were 3 accomplices. I was the victim of a Craigslist scam. Now, I should mention at this point that I am an attorney, and was at the time a law student. My desire for justice is a driving force in my life, and injustice infuriates me beyond my ability to express myself. I gripped the steering wheel tighter, white knuckled, and when the light changed I floored it. I screeched into a tiny gas station with two pumps and about 30 square feet of interior space. I bolted inside and surveyed the store. Most of it was a large glass box where the attendant would sit, sheltered from the pieces of shit that passed for people around here. My ass was exposed. I had tears streaming down my face, which was red as a tomato, and I was mad. Really fucking mad. A little old asian lady was sitting in the glass box, and we locked eyes. She was using a cordless phone. I locked onto that phone like a fucking fighter jet, and demanded, loudly, "GIVE ME YOUR PHONE." She pointed outside and said, "Use payphone." I had zero fucks remaining to give, and so I insisted. "LADY, I AM NOT FUCKING AROUND. THAT PHONE. YOUR PHONE. GIVE IT TO ME." She stared at me blankly, and slid it through the little window on the counter. I jabbed 911 and began shouting at the phone as soon as I heard a response. Location. Squad car. Name. Mugging. Battery. Now. I hung up. Not knowing that milk and oil are the best treatment for pepper spray, I walked to the soda vending machine. I pulled the plastic wrapper from a sleeve of large cups, stuck it in the ice dispenser, and filled the bag. I tossed the phone on the counter, thanked the nice lady for her help, and went outside to wait for the cops. As I sat there icing my face, they pulled up. I told them what happened, and they mumbled something into their radios. They calmed me down a bit, then put me in the squad car and drove back to the scene. I collected my missing flip flop and we looked for my phone but didnt see it. Back in the squad car, and they drove me next door to a seedy motel. As we pulled in, I saw the small parking lot filled with cop cars, dogs, and officers everywhere. I got out, and retrieved my last crumpled cigarette from my cigarette-wallet. I asked a homeless man sitting on the curb for a light, and stood there, ass to the wind, smoking my cigarette of victory as the cops paraded my 3 assailants out of a second story room onto the balcony of the motel. I walked up the steps, looked them each in the eye, and provided affirmative ID to the officers, with some flair. "do you recognize this person?" "yes. thats the asshole that pepper sprayed me." "do you recognize this person?" "Yes. thats the piece of shit that beat on me." " Do you recognize this person?" "Yes. thats the cunt that set me up." This got a laugh from the cops, as they snickered and led them downstairs. They took me to the precinct to finish up the report, document the craigslist post, etc. I borrowed a cell phone and called my mom (i was staying with them over the summer) and lied, telling her I ran into my friend and was hanging out with him but would be home soon. They had freaked out and were calling police stations to file a missing person's report at this point since I wasnt answering my phone. My wallet was returned to me, soggy, in a paper bag, since they had tried to flush it. I added insult to injury when I used the bathroom, thinking I had washed all the pepper spray off my hands. Wrong. My dick began to sting but by this point it was the least of my worries. They took me back to my car, I threw on some shorts I had in there, and went home to fill my family in. They were hysterical, but my dad thanked me for lying to my mom until I was there tell her in person. The next day my boss berated me for showing up a few minutes late. I told him the story, showed him my shiner, and he gave me a pass, but I would later reflect on that morning as the first of many instances in which he treated me like crap. I grew to hate him even more than my attackers. In the end, they all went to jail for several years. The last of them just ended their probation this month. In the mean time I finished law school, got engaged, paid off half my student loans, and made something of myself. Fuck those guys. edit 3/13 for answers, tldr, and more information: To AlyceSparks and everyone else scared of Craigslist: Later the next day, I met up with someone else from Craigslist and bought the phone from them, at the same price. My parents were freaking out, and I'll admit I was a little nervous, but I wasn't going to let those assholes affect my life. At all. This is America, fuck them, I was going to buy that phone come hell or high water, and if that guy tried to screw me over too, I'd fuck him right back just like I fucked them. Nowadays, I usually meet people at a well lit gas station downtown. I go to houses and stuff still, but never in that part of town. Never. I know much better. Not exactly a police station, but there are often cops parked there and lots of camera so its much safer. I have bought and sold hundreds of items on Craigslist without incident, and am a huge proponent of the service. This is by no means an anti-craigslist post. and for Nolat: Once the cops had the location of the incident (the apartments) and the time (like... 5 min ago) they figured, I guess, that they either couldn't have or probably hadn't gotten far. So, they searched nearby locations. They radioed a brief description that I gave them to some other officers while we were standing at the gas station, one of whom questioned the attendant at the motel next door. The attendant reportedly remembered checking in 3 people matching the descriptions recently and gave them the room number. Looks like they just jumped a fence and between the motel and apartments. I doubt there was even a room, they just wanted me to turn a less visible corner. Anyways, the cop called in the cavalry, and they surrounded the building. Then they called us over from the gas station, we swung by to get my flip flop, and by the time we got there, well... you read the story. What I can't convey properly was how FAST, once they showed up, they had these guys apprehended. Seriously efficient police work, I was blown away. Oh and there were probably so many cops since this location happened to be very close to the station. FML lol tl;dr: (Thanks to downbringer) OP goes to buy phone from Craigslist, sale is a setup for a mugging. OP gets maced and beat on, they steal his wallet (but not the money as OP was smart and hid it) and rip his jeans. OP pulls out switch blade and acts like a mad man to scare his assailants off. OP goes to petrol station and calls cops. Assailants go to prison, OP wins at life. 
Male 5'7" 223lbs. I started out at 238 three months ago and weighed in today at 223lbs! Mainly from cutting fast food, soda, late night eating. But the NSV victory is that I bought my first pair of jeans in 2 years from a local department store. I wore my last few pair until there were rags. Shopping was frustrating as hell when you're short and wide. You have to get your pants and jeans tailored because there are very few big and short stores in the world. It feels good to be able to shop in a normal store again. *Edit - I weigh in at 223 not 233. Oops. 
I need pants! I've been looking to get some kevlar riding jeans. Between those, and overpants I should be covered for 90% of my riding, but I have heard mixed things regarding riding jeans. Google doesn't seem to have much data on abarasion resistance for jeans, so I was wondering if you guys could offer some insight/suggestions on motorcycle jeans and their safety. 
Im looking at buying a pair of NB but want a casual pair that will go with most chinos, jeans so colourway has to be perfect.. I have been looking for a while and can't make my mind up, what are some styles and colours you recommend? I like the 996 and 574 any other styles i should check out? 
So I had a jeans crisis that began 3 weeks ago. Entering the fall season, I ripped two pairs of Express jeans that I bought last season in the same week and I needed a few new pairs ASAP. I had a few other pairs from the past but none that fit. My H&amp;M / LOGG denim that I bought in Germany was out of style in the US. The skinny jeans I bought last year I couldn't get past my thighs (I put on about 25 lbs of muscle in the last year). The only pairs I had that fit were 514s I got on sale at Macy's last year which fit great in the seat and thigh, but at the calf was so baggy that I could fit another leg in there if I needed. I have tried on 511's as well but they are simply too narrow, whereas last year they would have been my go to cut. I looked around for solutions online and saw that Levi's had a 513 that is slim past the knee but the same seat and thigh as the 514. Problem was neither Macy's, Penny's, Kohl's or Target had 513's in stock or planned to get them. Knowing that Levi's has inconsistent fabric qualities depending on where you shop, I wanted to make sure the denim would last. I looked around at other stores but nothing in Gap, Express, or other mall stores had the fit I needed at a competitive price (my aim was not to spend more than $40 per pair). Using the regular discounts on the Levi's website, with Coupon codes from and (student discount code for Levi's) I found two pairs I liked, Moulded Slate and Rounded Out, with shipping for $78 total. The moulded slate in a 34x32 fit perfectly on my normally 33x32 waist (size in my previous 514s). But the Rounded Out was much too large. I am sending back the Rounded Out. I placed another order through the website for Cash and smaller pair of Rounded Out, both in 33x32. This time both fit great but the Rounded Out ran a bit long. Not a real problem as I like the way it bunches over shoes. The Moulded Slate (darker pair) is the thinnest feeling denim but still feels of higher quality than either Express pair I replaced or the in store ones I tried on. All in all, I am mostly satisfied with the quality on their site and the fit. A few warnings: * There are definite quality concerns over the various retailers. The Amazon reviews show that they get a lot of inferior quality denim. The 514s I tried on at Kohl's had great quality in a very dark pair and absolutely abysmal in a lighter wash. I'm talking horrid tissue paper feel on every pair in that color. * Additionally, even between the same fits (513, 514, etc) the different denim colors and washes can vary pretty substantially in length and width. Like I mentioned the Moulded Slate runs slim in the waist and the Rounded Out is long in the leg. * Beware of deals through the online store at Macys, Penny's, Kohl's and Target for any Levi's products as I imagine the denim quality is suspect. The 514's from the in-store Macy's I bought last year are great and I used them as the standard for which I compared their other denim to. I'm not saying don't shop online, but be prepared. Conclusions: * 513's are a great fit for guys with larger thighs who still want a slimming jean. * Levi's may have quality issues based on where you shop so make sure you can return if needed. * There are many online deals to take anywhere from 10-50% off. Watch clearance on their website, * does not have a standard free return policy and are charging me 7.50 restocking fee on the pair I am sending back. Edits * Regarding further quality issues, Kohl's had a 514's with decent quality denim but the seamwork was awful around the pockets, and was bunching in a way that ruined the look of the flat front. Another thing to look for when considering a purchase. For those asking for measurements 22.5 inch thigh at the widest point. &gt; You can ask a live chat agent to waive the return shipping fee by mentioning that you weren't aware of it when you purchased it. I've had it waived that way without any problems. Thoridin &gt; One thing to note is that 514s are lower rise than 513.

Is there a consensus on the go-to silhouette, or are we transitioning from skinny jeans to boyfriend jeans? Would you say skinny is definitely on its way out? Do you think the boyfriend jean style is a rebellion against the all-revealing painted-on skinny style, and we're en route to somewhere in the middle - a relaxed but fitted style that doesn't quite cling? I'm curious about the status of a long list of other variables, too: * cuffing above the ankle * rips and tears * black jeans * jeans that you'd wear with ankle boots * jeans that you'd wear with tall boots * rise * slouchy butts and will I ever learn to love them * wearing slouchy jeans with a slouchy top * if your jeans are too long, do you get them hemmed, do you cuff them (to where?), or do you let them bunch up at your shoes * are we belting jeans now If it matters, I am in my late 20s, wearing jeans mostly on weekends, and the style to which I aspire could be described as Kate Middleton but I end up with "if Kate Middleton suddenly weren't a millionaire and worked in a business casual office and enjoyed live music." Aim for elegance, land somewhere around trend-conscious with a reluctance to adopt the styles from a decade ago. 
I noticed the other night that almost all the button holes in my ST120X were fraying. It's probably all the boozing I've been doing recently that wore them out. I've been hitting the watering holes pretty frequently these past couple weeks (thus hitting the restrooms frequently as well). The jeans were purchased 2nd hand, so I'm not sure exactly how much these have been worn, seller told me that he wore them less than a couple weeks? When I got them they had very minimal signs of wear (minor fading in the back pockets). From what I could tell, it was probably me who wore the button holes out. I pulled out a needle and black thread and [went to Searched the past posts and haven't seen anything about people fixing button holes so I had to rely on YouTube for help in performing the proper stitch. Pictures 1 and 2 are of the top two buttons in the fly (not including the top most button) and the ones in the worst condition. Picture 3 is a button hole with the initial thread &amp; needle pushed through the denim. Picture 4 and 6 are completed repairs. Nothing to write home to mom about, but I feel like by the time I got done with the second hole, I kinda got used to manipulating the needle and I think my next one will be much better. Let me know if any of you have ever tried it and have any tips. If you haven't, what do you do when your button holes fray? I can't be the only one this happened to. 
I work at a gasoline station full time, and of course, we always get weird people rolling through buying their cigarettes, beer, and cheap hot dogs. My job is either to ring them out, make food, or do tasks around the store. I often come to work straight from classes at university, so I always change my clothes in the bathroom. Sometimes, to save time, I just pull on my work shirt over whatever I'm currently wearing if it's easier to just use my normal clothes as an undershirt. This particular day, I had come back after a particularly hot day, and was wearing some jeans and a tank top. I admit, my tank top was a bit low cut, but I wasn't inappropriate. I had walked past the counter on my way to the back when a woman starts grumbling to her boyfriend in line about my shirt. Just normal stuff, like, "Why does she feel the need to dress like that?" and "Who is she trying to impress?" I ignore her and pull on my t-shirt atop my tank top and fasten my name badge, tie up my hair and walk out to the front after clocking in the help the customers. And the lady goes ballistic on me. I don't know what got under her skin, but she completely bypassed the queue to walk up to my register and starts shrieking at me. &gt;Customer: I can't believe they hired you! You just walk in with your tits hanging out! And then you expect me to treat you like everyone else? Now I'm kind of shocked, because woah, she got angry after I put on more clothes? I stare at her in shock and try to collect myself. &gt;Me: Well, I interviewed well. How can I help you today? &gt;Customer: You can take your tits and go home! I thought this place was more classy than this. And without any other words, she dropped all her items on my counter and walked out. And stood next to the door shouting at other people about the "skank behind the counter." I just don't understand. **edited in tl;dr:** Lady got offended by my excessive amount of clothing. Says I can take my tits and go home. 
Going into Burton for a new pair of jeans last week saw me faced with either 'Regular', 'Slim', 'Skinny' and 'Super Skinny'. I made the sales assistant giggle at least when I demonstrated that you can barely get your arm all the way through a leg of the 'super skinny' jeans. Seriously, why do they make clothes to fit an idealised version of what they think a person should be (clearly with the legs of a 6 year old...), as opposed to what people actually are? 
I'm a Software Engineer, and I was invited to a meeting to discuss job opportunities for my self in a medium sized startup. There were no discussions of the exact position, ?nd it's not a job interview. More like a get-to-know-each-other kind of thing to see if we have any thing to offer each other. The meeting, as far as I understand, is with the CEO of the company. He's a young guy and the company itself seems pretty "hip". So... What's the dress code for such a situation? I know that usually business meetings, especially first ones, call for a proper suit. But this seem to me a way too casual situation for a suit, and I have never ever in my life seen any one in the field wearing a suit, so I'm a bit awkward about overdressing for the occasion. Worth mentioning it's the first time I have any sort of business meeting in Finland, so I'm pretty much in the dark experience wise. Back in my home country (Israel) I would feel comfortable enough with jeans and a t-shirt, but I have noticed dress codes are much more important in Finland.

Hey everyone, Today I decided to wear a new pair of booties I bought which are a bit higher up the ankle than usual. They maybe rise up 1.5" from the ankle and because of this, when I wear them with skinny ankle jeans (leg opening about 10"), the jeans are bunching up a bit around the opening of the booties and it is driving me nuts. I know this is a common look and I'm sure it's not as big of a deal as I am making it but I just feel like I despise when jeans don't hug your leg to prevent this from happening. Maybe eventually I'll get used to it? But for now I'm bothered by it enough that I'm considering wearing these booties only with tights/dresses or jeans that are SUPER skinny where this won't be a problem. Buying jeans with that fit though is gonna be really hard considering I'm rather short and skinny and I'd imagine I would need about an 8" leg opening or so. Has anyone else felt similarly about this, or if not, this should be something I can get over right? I had a pair of leather boots that bunched up a bit around the ankle because they were lace up but after a while it wasn't something I noticed anymore. I'd imagine this could be the same situation if I stop thinking about it. 
About a week ago I submitted a post asking where you all got your favorite jeans, and there was an amazing response with all kinds of suggestions! I made a list of the most commonly named stores, and held my breath as I drove to a mall about 2 hours away that had most every store recommended. *Could it be true? Could the girls at The Girl Survival Guide really be angels sent from some Jean Goddess to teach me where to find the perfect pants?* YUP. Thanks to you all at The Girl Survival Guide, I found my perfect jeans yesterday. They were LITERALLY the *FIRST PAIR I TRIED ON*. I seriously could have **CRIED**. And I mean tears of happiness, not the normal tears I get when I am typically trying to find a nice pair of jeans. I'm sure you all know the ones... they come after thoughts like, "Am I seriously the only person in the world shaped like this?" "HOW did I get so FAT IN JUST THIS ONE PLACE?" and all other depressing and generally unrealistic conclusions a girl's brain can come up with during frustrated pants shopping. They were the REAL STRAIGHTS from GAP. They came the most highly recommended, so that's where I went first. I still checked out the jeans at every other store just because I had driven 2 hours and wanted to see what everyplace had to offer, and for MY pear shape the only other store that did me any favors was LOFT, but, unfortunately, they were missing one size, and it was mine... and I wasn't about to size down in "hopes" that my body would eventually size down too. These two stores (GAP and LOFT) both offered straight leg, all rises, and dark colors for the most flattering jean combo for a pear shaped body. Not to mention, they feel like real JEANS and not jeggings. If I wasn't broke, you can bet your sweet (and cute, because you're wearing the perfect jeans) little asses I would give you all Reddit Gold.

Howdy! So my beloved kevlar jeans have developed an unfortunate hole in an unfortunate location so it's time to get replacements! I'll be heading to J&amp;S accessories in Braintree and I'm hoping that someone will recommend a good pair to me before I depart. =) 
I have bigger thighs. I run a lot so I blame it on that. I'm looking for 32 x 30 pants, but they all crush my balls. I recently picked up one pair of loose fit jeans from Express and they are awesome. my guys have room to breathe. This was the only pair they had in store. Do any other stores have loose fit jeans? Online retailers? I'll try anything. EDIT: I should have said... I want these to look nice. Not the typical plumber jeans or construction guy jeans. I just want a comfy jean to wear out without having my muscular thighs from crushing my balls.

I work in the South Pole. I'm aware that sounds exciting, and it truly is, but it’s a difficult job with taxing hours. We were sent to the middle of Antarctica, with a thousand miles of snow and ice on all sides. We worked a solid 7to5 and with the lack of recreation, we typically do 18 hour days. However, we do have slow, satellite wifi, which is what keeps me sane during the long days. Regardless, all this wasn’t the problem. The problem was the sheer atmosphere of… oppression. The whole place didn’ t feel right. Most of the facility is subterranean with covered heaters atop the roof and an entrance into a cement stairwell. The bunker is what you'd expect: grey, concrete square with men and women's bunking areas (and a few couples rooms), a large bathroom facility with shower and toilet stalls, plus 3 labs and a fully stocked cafeteria, all with no windows. There was also a medical bay, and two rooms with couches (for therapy). After the double section entrance was the rec room, it had a pool table and bar, the wall was notty pine wood panelling like from the 1970s. The rooms were all attached by a long, dingy hallway, including 2 offices with desks and chairs (spent most of my time there). Atop the station was an observation deck, reachable with a ladder, with windows where we could see and hear the outdoors, but we usually only went up to smoke since it was nearly as cold as the outside. The whole place was poorly lit. Florescent lights and a few lamps in corners, but overall it looked like a dingy-green, underground, cement hell. Outside is exactly what you would expect from Antarctica. Snow for hundreds of miles in all directions. If you have a fear of open water, it feels like that, except you have to walk in it. I was a little surprised as to why they invited so many on this particular expedition. There were 12 of us total, usually 6 would suffice. All professionals in our fields. However, the range of work each of us did was surprising. Typically, it would be a singular field of study to accomplish a common goal, but on this expedition there were several different professions. The first was an older, Finnish gentlemen, a medical doctor, who was skilled in healing injuries in frozen climates. The next was a physicist who really was as surprised as us to be in the south pole, for their work is often theoretical and when in practice requires a team in and of itself. The next two were a British husband and wife team, both geologists. There were three men in their 30s for maintenance and driving, specialized in sub-zero conditions and masters in any repair field. Also, there was biologist, a young black lady who wore her hair in a bun and kept her lab coat on at all times inside; she was all work and no fun. Then there were even two therapists. Yes, two therapists. The first is what you'd expect: a middle aged lady with blonde bangs and a clipboard, always wearing a warm smile. The other… well, he was a tall, lanky fellow. He was gaunt and his hair was jet black. Honestly, I had no idea why he would be a therapist, I myself was intimidated to even say hi to him. I never saw anyone join him in therapy unless he specifically asked them. I usually tried to avoid him. There was another man who I assumed was a cook, until I saw we had to make our own meals. He was an odd, mousy looking fellow. He didn't speak to anyone, and when I tried he would simply ignore me. I maintained that he would be my favorite person on this expedition, since he kept 100% to himself. Me? I was the chaplain. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. There are half a dozen professionals here and they need a chaplain? Well, I didn't think it made sense, but when I was contacted by the organization funding the trip I didn't argue. They were offering a lot of money, and in my line of work that is a rarity. The expedition was to be 6 months and we were to each conduct specific experiments. I don't know what the others were assigned, but I was to journal on the religious implications of the expedition, and provide any council for all the other participants on the trip, of any sect or faith. The council assignment I didn’t have a problem with, but the journalling? That's the kind of thing college freshman journal on in Theology 101. Either way, I was getting paid, so I sucked it up and spent the rest of my free time downloading movies and games to pass the long hours in between counseling. Surprisingly, a lot of people came to me for religious discussion. I won over the maintenance guy's approval when I cracked open a beer with them and talked Catholicism on the old, red rec room couch (I'm a Protestant minister so they were a little stand offish at first). We became fast friends and even though I couldn't bless them or give confession, I think it helped ease stress to feel like they could disclose matters of faith as well as just have fun conversation. Either way, I got along well with everyone after enough time. The physicist was a staunch atheist so we played pranks on each other frequently. I would hide his laptop out of easy reach blaring "Jesus Take The Wheel" and he would wake me up half the days with "No Church In The Wild." I considered him my second best friend in the compound (even though that song did give me chills when I thought about how far away we were from civilization). My "best friend" was the odd man. He was always around the rec room when I was and he never spoke. He wore an orange hoodie and jeans indoors, and always seemed like he was drinking alone at the dimly lit, makeshift bar. I thought nothing of it since our schedules were all different, and I could absolutely condone drinking yourself senseless in a place like this. It was lonely most days. We did our own thing at our own stations, often eating lunch there (frozen meals or MREs usually). I did sped quite some time talking with the doctor. He was a Buddhist, so we spent many mornings meditating in his medical station under the buzzing florescent lights. He said that the place gave him an odd feeling. It was hard to be centered here in this cement brick, buried in the snow. It did get to me after a while. When I was alone and the lights were quiet I swear I could hear... whispering. After one particular incident, where I swore I heard clear words, I started wearing headphones. They helped quite a bit with filling my ears with noise and blocking out the outside world. Once a week supplies were dropped in from the coastal base hundreds of miles away. We restocked the cigarettes, whiskey and other non essentials like food and water. I say that to point out whoever was paying for this was dropping serious money. I never met the main client. Rather, I was contacted through their representatives. Apparently, the man funding it was very wealthy, very driven and very religious, and he was highly invested in this expedition. He wanted a success, but no one knew his goal with this ordeal he was funding. Also, once a week we would go out in the snow-rover. A giant SUV that could ride over the snow and ice. We would take samples of the ice and examine a previous dig site from the last crew. I could not imagine the crew that had to come all the way out here to build the facility, but I bet they got paid crazy money. Some days we would all go just to get out and see the sun (we couldn't leave during a blizzard), but most days only the necessary crew for the excavation would go. Whenever we went, we had to wear a harness attached by rope to the SUV, to avoid slipping down the ice and being injured. We can only go once a week due to the outside conditions and distance to the dig site. I mention both of these to say that we were alone out here, and if a plane came Monday, then we had 7 days until it returned. Then was the first big shift. It was exactly 2 months in the base. The team who left that day were the geologists, the biologist with one maintenance man to drive and man the harnesses. They left in good spirits and remained at the site for hours. However, they returned... shaken. They burst in the door while I was in the rec room with the therapist, and we immediately noticed the fear in their eyes. The lady geologist ran to the couple's room without saying a word. Her husband chased after, calling her name. We ask what happened and noticed the biologist was crying. The other therapist entered the room like a ghost, and without a word he ushered her into his office and closed the door. The doctor burst in and boomed, "what on earth is going on?!" "I don't know," said the first therapist. She was anxious, as was I. "Where's Jack? (the maintenance worker who drove the SUV) Wait, where's the car?!" I inquired, opening the door to the outside. I saw nothing but our flag, a long set of footprints and miles of ice gleaming in the sunlight. We sat for what felt like hours in the rec room, all of us who didn't go on the field expedition that is. The others were in the tall therapist's office. Panicked voices could be heard behind the door. Finally, they all exited. The geologists went to their room without saying a word. The biologist sat in one of the empty folding chairs. The therapist stood behind her, hands on the back of her seat. She had clearly been crying since she returned. "We got there ahead of schedule," she started, gathering her composure, "the dig site, we arrived at 0700 instead of 8, so we got to work early. At first all was fine. Jack was in the SUV minding the harnesses. I was chiseling away at a small patch of ice, when I heard the others call from below." We looked at her, hanging on her every, shaking word. She continued, "I slid down to the base of the hole... about 30 meters down, I think. They had struck a hard surface. We all dug together and pulled out a massive lockbox. Immediately we assumed it was left from the last dig, but the design was.. old. It looked like something from World War Two, it was heavy and sealed shut. We tugged the rope to signal Jack, but there was no response. We started calling out for him, but he never called back. We couldn't see him from our vantage point. After a solid ten minutes of screaming we made our way up the hill using our tools. We used an extra length of cord to pull the box up. It took all three of us, but we got it up. When we reached the top, Jack was nowhere to be found. We searched the perimeter for well over an hour, but with maximum visibility we would have seen him. We checked for holes in the ice and signs of foot prints, but his earlier tracks never left the side of the SUV. We loaded the box in the back, and kept searching. We noticed something then. Something we absolutely should have seen already. When we climbed atop the vehicle for a better vantage point we saw a massive, single message in the snow… Run." We looked at her in disbelief. The mutual feeling of sympathy and that 'I could've searched better’ people tend to have. She started tearing up again, "We panicked. W-we drove away, but none of us can operate a vehicle designed for snow and ice. We crashed into a massive pot hole about a mile south of here. We left the car and walked back. The find is still there and Jack is somewhere in that deserted wasteland." After this she broke down in sobs and left to the dorm. Jack hadn't answered a single radio call or even made an attempt at reaching us. The dig site was an hours drive from our base, and we were thousands of miles from any other researchers. We were essentially powerless to do anything. "First things first," said the one of the other repairman, "we need to get our ride back." He suited up, then he, and the other maintenance worker left on a snow mobile designed for short distance. Now, I don't know how they did it, but they managed to bring the SUV back safely in less than an hour. By now it was getting dark, and the search for Jack would be too dangerous to continue tonight. We didn't sleep that night. The odd man didn't even come to bed. He just wandered the halls drinking. I lay there, listening to music to drown out the sounds of silent sobs coming from down the hall. This concrete slab. This tomb in the middle of a frozen dead-zone. We were completely an utterly alone. The doctor remarked before bed, “if Jack is still alive, he may be better off out there." The next morning we set out. All of us, except the two therapists and the odd man, who I assumed was sleeping off a hangover. We dragged the locked box out of the vehicle and laid it in the rec room. We loaded up and decided to deal with opening it later. We searched the dig site and surrounding area until evening and turned up nothing. The message in the snow was nowhere to be found, and there had been no snowfall that night. We found no tracks, no signs, no body… no anything. We returned depressed and feeling responsible for our missing companion. When we returned however, we were greeted by an odd sight. A Jet. On the snow was a ski-fitted jet, and not like the crappy junk plane that dropped us off, this was an expensive private jet. We entered the facility to the sounds of loud, booming laughter. A short, bald man with a white goatee sat in the rec room with the shrinks. He was smoking a cigar and wore a very nice suit. Two very large men in sunglasses stood on either side of the door. We were slightly stunned. “Well!" the man said in a hard southern drawl, turning to us, "if it ain't the rest of the party!" "Who-" I was cut short. "Allow me to introduce myself!" He stood, extending his ringed hand, "Earl [redacted]! Pleased to meet you all, finally!" We took turns, awkwardly introducing ourselves, realizing this must be the guy in charge. He invited us into the cafeteria to have an official meeting. This was the second weird shift in the trip. He offered condolences in regards to Jack and expressed that it was no one's fault he went missing. "As for that message in the snow," he said, lowering his voice, "I would say this whole place tells you to run at some point. Don't let it get to you." He finally revealed his focus of the expedition, that we were to discover any signs of past visits man had ventured. He also expressed that he wanted to colonize the South Pole, but needed to know the psychological effects of people living here. That’s why he sent two mental health associates and a minister (he pointed at me saying this, making me feel exposed and awkward). He again thanked us and sent us to bed after the best steak dinner I've ever had prepared. This guy was serious. He flew in his personal chef to thank us for our work. The next morning, after a bacon and eggs breakfast, he took us into the tall therapist's office, one at a time to "shoot the shit" as he so delicately put it. When it was my turn he was very respectful, a gesture I appreciate when no one knows I'm a minister, but it feels forced at times when there is pretense. "How are you reverend?" He asked softly. "Well," I replied, not sure how to answer that question in light of the past few days. "Glad to hear it," he smiled at the ground, "Son, I'm going to level with you. You are the most important person here." "How's that?" I inquire. Wondering if he's flattering me or not. "Well," he started, looking for the right words, “This is trip is more for psychological research than anything.” “Wha-“ He cut me off. “We wanted a religious figure and at least two therapists to log the mental strain on living out here. We want to build a new civilization, but we have been testing different groups in small segments of time.” “Why me?” it was the foremost of many pressing questions. “Well,” He said smiling, “I’m a Methodist boy myself, but I picked you because of an article you wrote a while back. You said in the final line that you have the same philosophy as me.” “What’s that?” I inquired as I had written a few articles in my time and wasn’t sure which one he meant. “To truly understand God, we must also understand His counterpart.” I immediately knew the article to which he referred. It was an article I wrote after Seminary on Demonology in modern society. I shuddered as this was an… unpleasant field of research. Either way, the man had done his work on me, but I still wasn’t sure what a short article on Demons qualified me for a mission in the Antarctic. I left the room with Earl and we proceeded to rejoin the others. We predominantly listened to him rant on, rather than talk amongst ourselves. We just didn't feel right. We were here, in the warmth while this man was bellowing on, and our friend was out there cold and alone. I overheard many times the biologist and geologists ask to leave. At first their requests were simply brushed off, but by the last requests he sternly reminded them that they were under contract. They resolved themselves to their rooms after that. Earl left that night, with the instruction to report our findings, if there were any. He then boarded his plane with his bodyguards and left promptly. Before bed I swear I heard whispering from the observation deck, but when I went to see there was nothing. The next day a massive blizzard rolled in. We resolved that Jack had died in the snow outside, no person could survive a sub zero blizzard after three days. This is officially where things went bad. We decided to open the lock box. It was sealed by metal welding all the way around. It took a little while, but the other two maintenance men used blowtorches on the chest until it finally came free. They strained to pull the lid off it's container. We gathered around close, I found myself the closest to the box. They flipped the heavy lid over which shook black soot loose from the chest. We coughed and when it cleared we saw the contents. There was nothing. Or at least nothing important. We found a piece of string, a thimble and salt scattered about. We sat there rubbing our heads and looking at each other. We discussed why this would be out there in the ice, so many layers deep. We talked a little while until I noticed the physicist leaving. He was pale as a ghost, so I chased him to ask what was the matter. "Hey!" I shouted as I caught up to him in the dorm, "you good?" He stood there shaking his head. After a long pause he responded, "no." "What is it?" I was curious as to why he was acting so strange out of nowhere. Meanwhile I saw the other participants walk down the hall to the cafeteria, only I noticed that the man in the orange hoodie was no where to be seen. My thoughts were shaken when the physicist spoke up. "Did you see the word on the lid?" He asked quietly. "No," I was confused, I must have missed it. "Can you read Hebrew?" He asked, choking back tears it sounded. "No," I replied, "I studied Greek. Wait, can you?" “Yeah, I'm Jewish, or was. I can read well enough Hebrew at least," his voice shook, "I wish I couldn't" "What did it say?" "Dibbuk." He said as a tear rolled down his face. I had never seen him like this before and frankly, I was a little scared. "You can't buy into tha-" "No!" He shouted, cutting me off, "You know as well I as do that this place is wrong! It does things to you! God, the first week I chased footsteps around the shower every morning only to realize I was alone every single time." "Listen," I placed my hand on his shoulder, "we're going to be ok." I wish I could say I was telling the truth, but that box did have some sort of weird feeling around it. I That night around 2AM I awoke to the sound of footsteps. They were so loud I heard them over my headphones. I went to check around and no one was awake besides me. I heard soft sobbing from the couple's room, but knew better than to disturb them. They had it pretty rough right now. As I returned to my bunk, I walked by the cafeteria and caught something... Awful. I turned to see the most horrendous sight I have ever seen. All the chairs and tables were scattered and flipped. Food was smeared all along the walls and ceilings and utensils and appliances were scattered about. In the center of the floor was a massive, rusted steel cross and nailed to it was... Jack. He was soaked from head to toe in blood and his eyes looked as if every vein had burst. Barbed wire covered his arms and legs and nails were driven through his wrists and ankles. He was bald and thin and when we made eye contact he shook violently, then he shrieked through spattering blood, "BELPHEGOR" Now was my turn to lose control. I fell backward and slid on the tile. I must have been screaming my lungs out, for everyone poured into the hallway asking in confusion what was happening. I had urinated. I pointed to the cafeteria through tears and panicked breaths. The inside was totally normal. Nothing was out of place. No cross. No Jack. No destruction. The last thing I remember was showering and opening a bottle of Jack. It was only three hours later I awoke in the rec room covered by a blanket. Jane, the therapist, was asleep on the opposite couch. She was sweet through all of this, and I'm sure she was disappointed in my lack of professionalism. I was still drunk when I stood. Everyone was still asleep and the blizzard still blasted our compound. I wandered the hall and heard the sobbing from the couples room again. I realized in my stupor that they may need help. I knocked softly on the door, but the crying continued uninterrupted. Before I could knock again I had to resolve myself to the toilet. I ran and vomited into the bowl, now feeling slightly more alert. As I stood wiping my mouth I caught the brief glimpse of a figure leaving the bathroom. It was dark and tall, but I couldn't catch any more details. I finally had enough and returned to my bunk. I fell into a restless sleep that night, but I slept nonetheless. I awoke the next day to someone shaking my arm. "Wake up,” my vision focused to see one of the maintanence men, “Power’s out and people are missing.” I stood groggily. He turned to the hallway, where I could here voices in the cafeteria. I saw the only other person in the room was the physicist, he was facing the away towards the wall. “C’mon,” I slurred. He didn’t stir. He just laid there. I only left because I saw him breathing. I walked into the cafeteria. It was lit by emergency candles on the tables, where I saw the Biologist, Jane, the Doctor and the two maintenance men. Counting me, this was less than half our original group. They turned and the other maintenance man said, “Well, look who it is, you gonna scare the hell out of us again?” I didn’t smile or disagree. I just sat beside the doctor and asked where the geologists were. “They won’t answer their door,” Jane said, her age truly beginning to show in her tired, drawn eyes, “The other therapist as well is missing.” “We’re going to leave,” chimed the Biologist, “as soon as the blizzard dies down. Fuck their contracts.” “How? We’re a thousand miles from the nearest base,” I felt negative for saying, but I didn’t want to risk certain death for a little cabin fever. “Well,” chimed the man who woke me, “We have a massive sled we’ll load with every tank of gas, then we just have to get within 50 miles to the nearest base to be within radio contact. We have gps, we’ll drive in shifts, and we’ll take our time as to avoid pitfalls." “Is this agreeable?” asked the doctor. Everyone nodded in agreement. “In that case,” he continued, “I suggest we spend the next few days together, hoping the missing members return, and if not... then we will beg their forgiveness in hell.” I spent the day sitting in a daze. I just had no clue why we were all so distraught. We all layered up in the dark and hunkered down. We made small talk in an attempt to fill the void. The dancing candle light played tricks on our eyes and the dark was oppressive. The six of us sat there. Just sitting. Just waiting. Finally, around 1800 (6PM) Jane suggested we check on the geologists. We stayed close down the hallway and heard the sobbing, it was softer but still present. Jane knocked. Waited. Knocked again. Then she shouted she was coming in, but the door was locked. The maintenance man began pounding his fist and threatened to break in. He took out a kerning and picked out a key. It fit the door and he slowly opened it to the bedroom. Inside was a nightmare. The first thing I noticed was the blood. It was everywhere. The walls, the bed, the ceiling, the floors. It covered the lamp and bathed the room in a deep red. On the bed was the male geologist. His eyes were wide open in shock and his mouth hung agape. His throat was torn out and his leg was chewed to the bone. His wife sate beside him with her bcd to us. She turned, covered in blood herself. She was crying and… chewing. She sputtered the bloody meat while sobbing. Her expression turned from sorrow to one of pure, unadulterated rage. She contorted her mouth to scream, but only a hoarse gargle and bits of flesh came out. The maintenance worker closed the door and we all panicked in unison. “Get the door!” The doctor shouted. We followed him to the kitchen and pulled tables in front of the door. We piled enough furniture to board that… animal in her cage. We returned to the rec room. Everyone was crying and Jane was in the fettle position shaking uncontrollably. “We leave tomorrow,” huffed the doctor in between shudders. The blizzard still raged outside. I swear, at times the wind was so loud I felt like it mocked me. I must have fallen asleep at some point because a massive blast woke me. I looked up to see others jumping to their feet. We got ourselves to the ladder and climbed to the observation deck. Outside, we saw blackness expanding, all except for a large patch of light a few meters away. Through the white out conditions we could make out… fire. The SUV was in flames, gas tanks stacked around it. Atop the flames was… a person. Upon closer inspection I could see it was naked and dancing. “Oh God,” the biologist lifted her hand to her mouth, “Jane?!” It was Jane. She was naked and being burned by the flames. Her howls echoed through the dark storm. We watched as the fire consumed her body. She shrieked and screeched until she finally fell, remaining silent forever. We walked downstairs. Feeling hopeless. We sat in the dark of the rec room, and no one spoke until morning. The physicist was still in bed, he was trying to ignore everything, but at this point I knew he was too far gone. The footsteps were loud in the unoccupied rooms, but at this point I had given up. If I was to die here then so be it. We huddled in blankets and coats against the wall. We sat and we cried. A candle in front of our feet was the only light source. I closed my eyes tight so not the see dark shadow pacing the room in front of us. The next morning the power returned. The lights were flickering and we stood slowly in the dim, intermittent glow. I heard music playing in the showers. We all walked together and looked inside. Within, was the song "Jesus Take The Wheel" being played on loop from an mp3 player. We walked into the dull grey room and saw the physicist naked, sitting on the floor in front of the ipod player. Blood appeared to be running into the drain beneath him. He slowly turned his head to me. He held up his left hand to his lips and hissed a long, "shhhhhhhhhh." With the other hand he lifted his bloodied, mutilated genitals. He closed his eyes and smiled a large toothy smile. He whispered behind closed teeth, "I like this song now." "God," said the doctor. He slowly approached the bloodied man, attempting to keep him calm. He continued, "It's ok boy, I'm here to help." The physicist snickered again, eyes still closed and teeth still bared in a snarling grin. As the doctor got close the man shrieked with inhuman volume and sprang forward. He tackled the doctor to the ground and sunk teeth deep into the old man's jugular. Blood ran down both the doctor's neck and the physicists teeth. He stood, turning his violent intent at us. The Doctor sputtered blood and choked for air. As the brooding man crouched to leap a loud “BANG” filled our ears. I fell to the ground in agony, the screeching in my eardrums was unbearable. Finally, it cleared and I saw the physicist now laying dead in a pool of his own blood. In his head was a circular wound that bore all the way through his skull. One of the maintenance workers was holding a smoking pistol. We were now four. Me, the biologist and the other two maintenance workers. The rest were now all missing or dead. Although the power was on the satellite was down, thus ruining our chances for radio and wifi. We all paced and cried and panicked for hours until finally one of the maintenance men spoke up, “Our only chance at survival is to fix that dish.” We looked at him and silently knew he spoke the truth. The outside was still completely whited out from the amount of snow and wind. “I’ll go,” spoke up the other man. “We’ll go together,” said the first. The Biologist and I knew we could not argue.	 We watched them in their coats leave into the unforgiving blizzard. We waited for what seemed like hours, searching for radio signals and wifi. Finally, it came back. We smiled for the first time in a while and prepared for the men’s return. We sat and waited. And waited. And waited. We didn’t say anything but we knew. We knew we were the last. She fell asleep in my lap after we cried ourselves tired. Before I closed my eyes I swear I heard the giggles of a child. I awoke sometime… later. I was utterly alone. I yelled for the biologist. I searched each and every room until I found the last thing I wanted to find. I found her in the observatory. She wrote a lovely note about wanting to see the outside world before she died. In her arm was an empty syringe that I guess is what she used to end her life. Her eyes were blank, staring into oblivion. I left her to her peace. Now, the reason I write this in my probable last moments of clarity. The reason we were brought to this frozen hell, only to die. The reason I’m sending out this story before I put an emergency flair gun down my mouth. I returned to the office I had been using. I was hysterical. I saw my reflection in the display mirror and noticed my eyes were totally black. This sight brought me to smash the mirror. I sliced my knuckles, which rocked me back to reality, and in my second of clarity, I noticed the slip of paper that fell from the shattered pieces. It was a note with a picture attached. The note read: “If you’re reading this then I hope it isn’t too late. This place is NOT what you think. The man in charge is not a religious kook. he is much more dangerous. By now you may have found that “undiscovered” lock box. In it you found some trinkets to spook you. There is probably a minister with you to comment on the materials as “evil.” This is there set and setting. That black dust that flew out? It wasn’t dust and it wasn’t evil. God, these people don’t want to colonize. Ever wonder why you’re so far away from any other bases? This is WEAPONS TESTING FACILITY! You have unknowingly been testing compounds for a private company. This particular compound is an untraceable, psychosis inducing strain of pathogen that is meant for world leaders. The concept is to have the enemy kill itself. If you’ve breathed the black dust, then it is too late. All you can do is attempt to get this message out. But DO NOT trust the maintenance men and DO NOT trust the tall therapist. They are working for Earl. They will disappear without a trace shortly after his visit. They’ve logged your behaviors so even if the blizzard (which is what I assume you’re already in) subsides, you’ll be found and killed if you escape. I’m so sorry. I lost my entire team. I wish you never would have come. I’m sorry- Dave” The picture attached was what I assume was the previous team. In red ink a man was circled and labeled “me.” In the picture was a mousy man in an orange hoodie and jeans. 
I requested a floating jean day and they turned me down :( 
A few months ago I had a dream that has stuck with me ever since. In the dream I'm walking through a meadow in the fall around sunset, my SO on my left, and a strange girl on my right. I'm holding both of their hands and skipping through this meadow I've never seen before. My SO looks exactly the same. This other girl is about the same height as my SO, long light brow hair, green eyes, freckles and glasses. She's wearing blue jeans, a black top, a leather jacket and a grey beanie. We continue skipping through this meadow, I take turns looking at both of them and smiling, but my SO doesn't seem to notice this other girl. Each smile from both girls puts me at ease, and in this dream I'm extremely happy. I trade one last look with this mystery girl, and turn to give my SO a kiss. When I do the dream switches from first person to third person, and the mystery girl disintegrates into almost flower pedals, and drifts away in the wind. Then the dream ends. What does this mean? If anything. Please help. 
I finally had to go and buy new jeans and a couple size M shirts to go with them because my size L shirts and 34 jeans (that were a NSV of their own last year) were getting too baggy. Just wanted to share. :) New duds are fun. :) 
My husband was injured recently and all of the cash in his wallet was covered in blood. It's about $400, so I'd really hate to have to just throw it away. I've already contacted my bank, but they weren't sure if they could take it since it's now a biohazard. They said they'd call me back either tomorrow or Monday, but I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else and if so, what their experience was. And what, if any, other options do I have if the bank won't take the money? Thanks! Edit: Whoa, this blew up over night. Thank you all for your advice. We ended up just putting the money in the pockets of an old pair of jeans and sending it through the washing machine, which worked well. And to all of the people who asked about my husband, he's okay. He just needed a few stitches. 
I was wondering what everyone heres' opinion on Just Jeans, they seem legit and the quality of their clothing looks decent. Anyone here buy from them frequently? What are your thoughts on their jackets and jeans? (leather jacket if any) 
After last month giveaways by Chubbies we've found a new swole brother. Barbell Apparel, the creator of the jeans for those with manly bottoms. Barbell Apparel is giving away 3 pairs of jeans &amp; 3 T-shirts, the same way Chubbies did. Pick a number and check if someone already used that one(ctrl+f) and you're in. &gt;1-10 000 &gt;The jeans contest is ending on 9/30/14 and the t-shirts on 8/30/14 
I'm 5'2" 120 lbs., 27 waist with an inseam of 27 in and I have the worst time trying to find skinny jeans/jeggings that are tight throughout the whole leg. In particular, I've been searching and searching for a pair of high waisted black skinny jeans with no luck. I get this problem where my ankle starts where the calf portion of the jean is still roomy, so I get a baggy straight leg instead. I found one pair of American Eagle jeggings that fit me like a dream, but the other washes (including black) seem to be made of various materials and aren't consistent in the fit. I've tried the well touted BDG high waisted twigs (and grazers) and Top Shop's high waisted jeggings but they're never tight and awesome like I see on other people's on FFA. Can anyone with the same leg length please direct me to your favorite high waisted skinny jeans so I can wear my crop tops and tuck in peace? 
Every year we see dozens upon dozens of films released. Lately -- the past four years to be exact -- we have seen some great years in film. 2015 looks to be no different from the previous years. I will list some of the films that I am hoping to see, and hopefully some more get added by some of you as well, I will continue to edit the thread if it has some success to be used as a guide for the year. I see some great directors releasing films, some great actors as well, and hopefully we get a year of many, many Oscar-worthy films. I will write a brief thought for some of them to hype up their release as well. 1. [The Walk]( (Robert Zemeckis): Zemeckis who directed the Back to the Future trilogy, Forrest Gump, Contact, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, etc. Brings us his version of the famous story of the french high-wire artist Philippe Petit, as he attempts to cross the Twin Towers back in the 1970s. "Flight," was his last release in 2012. 2. [The Sea of Trees]( (Gus Van Sant): The man who directed Good Will Hunting, tells a story of a suicidal man (Matthew McConaughey) who travels to Aokigahara; the suicide forest. 3. [Everest]( (Baltasar Kormakur) A thriller starring the always underrated Jake Gyllenhaal based on the non-fiction book "Into Thin Air" by Jon Krakauer. Think "Into the Wild," but with Mt. Everest as the setting. 4. [Spectre]( (Sam Mendes) The man who brought us, "American Beauty," and the greatest modern Bond;"Skyfall," will again direct a surely beautiful film. 5. [Bridge of Spies]( (Steven Spielberg) Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg doing a thriller? If it's half of what "Catch Me If You Can," was, then sign me up! 6. [Black Mass]( (Scott Cooper) the same Scott Cooper who directed "Crazy Heart," that finally won Jeff Bridge's his oscar, now directs a biopic. The true story of Whitey Bulger. Who? I don't know either, but I can't wait to find out about him. Just looking at the cast, it will perhaps be a good one. Johnny Depp, Dakota Johnson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Juno Temple, etc. 7. [Love &amp; Mercy]( (Bill Pohlad) I'm a huge Brian Wilson fan, and it is a biopic about him, so that's that. 8. [By the Sea]( (Angelina Jolie) Brad Pitt stars in a drama about a couple that travel France together in the 1970s. 9. [The Revenant]( (Alejandro González Iñárritu) Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio starring in a movie by the current holder of every Oscar. I will not skip this one. 10. [The Martian]( (Ridley Scott) You've seen [the pictures]( and if you don't know anything about Ridley Scott, you might as well just take my word for it. He makes great movies. 11. [Self/less]( (Tarsem Singh) I'm fascinated by the whole /r/singularity and /r/futurology thing. So here's a movie with a great story it seems, and it should explore some very interesting topics as well. It even starrs Ben Kingsley. This should be good. 12. [Snowden]( (Oliver Stone) A movie about Edward Snowden, starring Gordon-Levitt, and directed by Oliver Stone. I'm thinking a modern-day "JFK;" a political thriller that will answer a lot of questions for sure. 13. [Joy]( (David O. Russell) Russell returns to his winning formula of Cooper, Lawrence and De Niro. This time he tells the story of a family that goes through four generations. Expect a huge successful drama with this one, and his always spectacular soundtracks. 14. [Concussion]( (Peter Landesman) Football is a great theme, and an NFL drama starring Will Smith, should be a blockbuster. Not to mention some of my favorite actors are in it; Albert Brooks, Alec Baldwin, Paul Reiser and Luke Wilson is rumored to play Roger Goodell. Sounds exciting. 15. [Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens]( (J.J. Abrams) You can come up with a thought of your own for this one. 16. [In the Heart of the Sea]( (Ron Howard) A biographical disaster drama-thriller in the 1820's. From the man who brought us "Rush," as his last theatrical release. 17. [Secret in their Eyes]( (Billy Ray) A remake of the famous ritically acclaimed Argentine film [El Secreto de Sus Ojos]( Oh if by the way you haven't seen it, please do. Ricardo Darín is splendid in it. 18. [Rock the Kasbah]( (Barry Levinson) Perhaps it won't be as great as some of the films listed, but it does have Bill Murray in it. 19. [Steve Jobs]( (Danny Boyle) A very anticipated film, set to be released in October. Directed by the incredible Danny Boyle, it tells the story of Steve Jobs. Hopefully it does indeed tell his story in an honest, unmerciful way, that could make this movie very special if it does. It stars Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels and a surprise casting of Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak. If he pulls it off, he could get some love in the awards season. It is not often that we get to see Seth in a biopic drama. 20. [Pan]( (Joe Wright) A blockbuster, and a story that's been told in every decade it seems, so we'll see if Wright can take advantage of his cast and a great story. 21. [Adam Jones]( (John Wells) The cast attracts me, the story doesn't provide much; A chef assembles a crew together in an attempt to create the best restaurant ever, per IMDb; 22. [Sicario]( (Denis Villeneuve) The man who gave us "Prisoners," tells a story of a carter hitman in a border town. It has Josh Brolin in it, and Benicio del Toro. It can be great. 23. [The Visit]( (M. Night Shyamalan) Hasn't really live-up to his Sixth Sense potential, but still, he deserves a mention in the list. 24. [Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation]( (Christopher McQuarie) Nothing more than a summer blockbuster film, but Tom Cruise is always very entertaining. 25. [The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]( (Guy Ritchie) Who doesn't love Snatch? Hopefully this one lives up to his older releases. 26. [No Escape]( (John Erick Dowdle) 27. [Trainwreck]( (Judd Apatow) 28. (Jared Hess) 29. [Creed]( (Ryan Coogler) 30. [Crimson Peak]( (Guillermo del Toro) The other famous Mexican director has a movie this year as well. Hopefully it can become more than just a date-flick. 31. [Ricki and the Flash]( (Jonathan Demme) The director of "Silence of the Lambs," and the Oscar-magnet Meryl Streep working in a very unusual story of an aging musician who wants to be a rock and roll star? Surely it can't be that bad. 32. [The Gift]( (Joel Edgerton) 33. [Southpaw]( (Antoine Fuqua) A boxing film by the man who once directed, "Training Day." It stars Jake Gylenhaal and Rachel McAdams. 34. [The Danish Girl]( (Tm Hooper) Eddie Redmayne plays a man/woman Lili Elbe. This one is actually inspired by a true story, and it has oscar nomination written all over it for Redmayna again. 35. [Demolition]( (Jean-Marc Vallée) Another film starring Jake Gyllenhaal, this time a drama, and directed by the same director of "Dallas Buyers Club." 36. [The Hateful Eight]( (Quentin Tarantino) The movie that was leaked. And no, it wasn't Snowden. Perhaps Mr. Orange? So the script is out, but the fans are still waiting for the actual film to be released. 37. [Jurassic World]( (Colin Trevorrow) Come on, who doesn't love the original? Steven Spielberg, directing one of the greatest American films ever. Using what it is perhaps the greatest CGI to date, and a film score for the ages. Those are some very big shoes to fill. 38. [Inside Out]( (Peter Docter, Ronaldo Del Carmen) A very ambitious story if you ask me. It can potentially work out as a very original and enjoyable family for all ages. 39. [The Good Dinosaur]( (Peter Sohn) 40. [Triple Nine]( (John Hillcoat) 41. [The Intern]( A Nancy Meyers film you say? Sure, I respond. "The Parent Trap," and "The Holiday," are both great, timeless family movies. Will look forward to this one. 42. [Trumbo]( (Jay Roach) 43. [Carol]( (Todd Haynes) 44. [Goosebumps]( (Rob Letterman) Could be a great adventure movie for the young ones. 45. [Straight Outta Compton]( (F. Gary Gray] The story of N.W.A. produced by Ice Cube, unfortunately he isn't featured in the cast. Hopefully we get a cameo. Edit: Added #36 to #45. Thanks to /u/GamingTatertot /u/Dazed_Cactus /u/MarioMoon for the suggestions and the reminders. So those are the ~~35~~ 45 films that I am looking forward to, the most. I Can't wait to watch every last of them. 
I was out with friends Friday night, not expecting much. I just wanted some drinks and have a good time. So I was there, me and about 10 or so friends. It can be busy but it isn't the busiest of bars in the world honestly. So we were there and were having fun chatting it up as usual. I went to get another drink when my friend Bryan followed me. He's one of my good friends and someone I've had a bit of a crush on for a while, we had hooked up once or twice and had a lot of fun with it. Sometimes I like being a little slutty with him, it is exciting in a weird way I wouldn't have thought it would be. But it is. Anyway, we ended up chatting at the bar together for a while and slowly forgot we were with other people. "I've always kind of wanted to hook up in a kind of public place" I admitted at one point. I wasn't sure if that was forward or not, I had a couple drinks at that point. "Yeah?" He said. I nodded. He glanced around. "Finish that drink and take my hand" he said. He grabbed my hand and pulled me through the crowd, past the main area to a quieter area. "Where are we going" I asked. He smiled, "do you want to fulfill that dream now?" I smiled back. He pulled me into a single bathroom, it seemed like no one was there. I smiled a little sheepishly at him. "Oh," I said. "Is this ok?" He asked? I smiled and slide my hands down his pants. He locked the door. Kissing me, he put one hand under my skirt, sliding it up. The other hand went down my bra. "You like this" he asked. "Whatever you want" I said. He slide my skirt off, taking my panties with it. He lifted off my blouse and unbuttoned my bra. Hs hands were on me and he pulled me close to me. I stood naked, my skirt around my ankles, pressed against him in a locked public bathroom. "You like this" he asked. I nodded. He stood me there, naked for him, he fondled my breasts. Then he kissed me. I could feel him grow hard under his jeans. And before I knew it he had grabbed me and lifted me up. As a pretty short person I am easy to lift, and that he did, putting me on the grimy sink. He unzipped his pants, letting his dick flop out. I felt exposed, sitting there naked while he was almost fully clothed. He stood upright, and let himself in. I felt him go into me. As he went I could feel him press my body against the sink and the wall. I sat there naked for him, he was clothed, except for his cock, My legs spread, as he sunk in. My tits jiggled and I breathed in sharply. He went in deep as I wrapped my legs around him, feeling the cold of the sink on me. He leaned in. There was a jiggle of the bathroom handle but he didn't pause for that. The person outside couldn't hear anything and they understood that someone was in there, so they stopped. Bryan speed up. I sat, naked, pressed against a wall of a bathroom, sitting on a sink as he grabbed me, fucked me. The metal was cold against me, but I didn't care. The sound of Bryan pushing into me was drowned out by the bathroom fan for anyone outside, but I could hear it perfectly. His pelvis slapped against mine. I could hear the sound of him against me, the wetness squishing every time he leaned in. He pushed in, once or twice I swear it hit my cervix. He grabbed my shoulders, pushing me against the mirror, and staring at me. He pushed in and in. I closed my eyes. He pushed in. I squeezed. He pushed in. I could feel my chest bouncing up and down. He pushed in. He pushed in. My hair stuck to my face. His hand pushing me against the wall. He pushed in. He moaned and he grunted. "Oh god, I love when you are slutty for me, do that for me" he said. He pushed in, and then pulled out. He pulled me off the sink. I grabbed his cock, I could tell he was close. I knelt down, putting my hand on his shaft and my mouth on his head. I could feel him, about to cum. I rubbed his cock, sucking his tip as he pulled out of my mouth. He shot onto me, I knelt before him naked on the bathroom floor. He got on my chin, dripping onto the rest of me. He grabbed my chest again as he dripped onto it. He tilted my head up, looking at me as I squeezed him, letting him trickle out. The man waiting outside for a tad bit too long seemed not effected at all by two people leaving the bathroom as we walked back to our group of friends. 
I don't know that I've ever been so happy in a dressing room. In fact, there have been many days that I've cried while trying on clothes. Today was not one of those days. Instead, I cheered! I finally hit "onederland" a couple of weeks ago, and was pretty happy in my size 11/12 jeans. I was trying on bathing suits yesterday, and the 12s were fitting pretty easy. So I thought maybe I'd try a pair of 9/10 jeans in my favorite curvy brand. And they fit! I even had to buy a 9/10 long because the inseam was too short on the regulars. (I also had a 20% off coupon, which made it even better!) At 262 pounds, I was a 16W. Now, at 199, I'm a 10. I didn't think I'd ever see that size again! Added a picture: 
So this is my problem. I always get a hole in the crotch area of my jeans. And almost always in the same place (left side of the central stitches). And this happens after about 3 months of total usage. I have tried mending them in several different ways. You can try to stitch them up, but then you get a small area sticking out in to the jeans that is really unconformable. Or you could try with a patch, but that makes the crotch area of the jeans really rough, and it does not feel natural. So I have been thinking. * I have been asking around and this seems to be a common problem, why does not the jeans manufacturers make that area tougher? * It should be possible to protect that area beforehand with some kind of chemical to toughen it up. Some kind of mix of epoxy and silicone. What you want is that area of the jeans still be able to follow your skin naturally and comfortably, and you don´t want to have some nasty chemicals near your crotch. But you want it to last as long as the rest of the jeans. I hate buying jeans, I really hate it. I usually get a girl involved so I know I get a good fit and also so she can go and fetch new ones to try out while im in the dressing. And for me it´s the most important part of clothing as a I, as a guy, can wear. So my question is: 1. Do you also have this problem? 2. How do you think is the best way of solving this problem? 3. What do you do with your old hole-ridden jeans? 4. Bonus: post pics of your jeans with holes. **Edit: Grammar and spelling**

I've never owned a super high-end pair of jeans before, but I always hear that you're not supposed to wash them. Ever. Like... ever. How are you getting away with this? It's not often that I sweat profusely in jeans, but after 3-5 wears they start to get a dingy odor. Not necessarily repulsive, but definitely a plea for a spin through the washing machine. Do high end jeans simply not retain odor? Do you store/hang your jeans in a specific way? Do you just febreeze your shit? What is this voodoo?! 
Bit of background: my parents are divorced. Before the crisis they had jobs with good salaries (a big house + 3 holidays a year kind of salaries). With the crisis, the cost of divorce and a bunch of irresponsible financial decisions they lost their jobs and most of their money, including my college fund. I'm now trying my best to get a double engineering degree at my university, while working my ass off to get through it all and be able to fund myself meanwhile. My parents are of absolute zero financial help, I have to pay for everything my self, I don't even get the occasional 10 bucks under the table, zero. I don't mind really, I get that they simply *can't* help and although money is tight, I manage on my own but of course it's not easy. My boyfriend's parents are still together, they are not well off by any means. His mum is a licensed practical nurse and his father does manual labor. Although they don't earn much, they are very good with money and often help my boyfriend out by paying his medical insurance and often pay for new clothes etc. Yesterday we went shopping for some new jeans my boyfriend needed. Without a problem his parents paid 150 bucks to buy him new clothes. I was glad for my boyfriend as he really needed it. At some point we went to our favorite local clothing store and while I was looking at some dresses (with no intention to buy them because, well, the dresses where 60 bucks and I simply can't spare that kind of money) his mum came up to me and said I should try it on and if I liked it she would buy it for me. I told her I appreciated it but really didn't need any new clothing, but she insisted and I got the dress. A dress I normally would have to save for for months, carefully considering whether I don't need the money for something else. Just, out of the blue, it wasn't even my birthday or something. Normally I get incredibly happy to get 20 buck from my parents on a gift card for my birthday so it makes it easier for me to buy something nice for myself, but this woman just gave me such a nice expensive dress out of nowhere. It made me incredibly emotional later that evening and I apped his mother to thank her yet again. She only said not to worry about it, as I was part of her family too and they treat all their children equally. I love my family. 
I have an issue, ladies. I'm 5', and "thick". I've been wearing the same jeans from Old Navy for YEARS....and I need to add some new jeans to the rotation as I'm down to ONE pair. However, the few places I've been to buy new jeans have frustrated me to hell because they're ALL skinny style or jeggings. My issue is that skinny jeans DO NOT work on me, even the short/petite cut ones because I have BIG thighs (think of a full grown pig's hocks) and I have to get pants hemmed no matter what. I want boot cut jeans or straight leg style jeans. I'm also on a bit of a budget, but wouldn't mind buying jeans at ~50.00 USD a pop if they're nice. Where do I go to find such mythical, magical pants? **Edit:** Thanks for all the suggestions, ladies! I'm going to wait until I'm not on my period and feeling all bloated before I go scope out some new jeans, but I'm excited! 
Before I start, I may aswell sum up mine and her relationship. Known each other since we were kids, had a great friendship, had a few times we tried dating here and there, none really worked out. Still amazing friends, I ended up dating her bestfriend for 2 years before splitting with her 9 months ago... And now I've just slept with her. Let's call her Cee. So anyway, literally just happened just over 24 hours ago. Was out on Saturday afternoon, decided to go hang out with Cee. We are both nearly 20 now, so it's safe to say it's been a while knowing each other. She invites me out to a family bbq, to which I say "why not" as I've nothing else planned for the weekend. Cee and I have had chemistry over the years but since we had grown up I thought it wouldn't cause any dramas Fast forward to the night, we decide to get "shit faced" because we have not yet been drunk together, which is strange for us (believe me). Bear in mind this is the girl who tells me about everyone she's slept with, what she liked, dislike... I know everything about her. I'm like the gay bestfriend yet... Not gay. Anyway, we are getting drunk, I'm enjoying the night and so is she, then it starts getting a bit heated. She appears to be trying to kiss me with her family around (again, family known for a good time so I was a bit antsy), to which she suggests I stay at hers on the sofa! Woohey! Haven't gotta go home pissed, result! Fast forward to midnight, her friends giving us a lift home, we stumble in (by this time we had been all over each other), lay on the sofa... Then the unthinkable happens... Cee and I just begin to lay down together and we start going down on each other... One thing lead to another and we are fucking like the high school lovers you see in any nsfw college porn clip. I won't lie and say it wasn't good... It was great, but almost immediately after... she started crying... She was getting upset and not long after, she asked me to leave... So there I am, walking the 40 minute journey home with a cock trying to escape my jeans, thinking what on earth did I do to do wrong, feeling like I've hurt her or, insulted her or something, feeling like a giant sack of shit. Now it's Monday, we have barely spoken, and I'm paranoid I've hurt her. I think she feels that I'm going to fall deeply in love with her (which won't happen), and she's scared it will ruin this great friendship.... Any advice redditors? Throwaway for obvious reasons. TLDR: Fucked best girl friend of 12 years, she cried, walk of shame home at 2am with my dick trying to gasp for fresh air. UPDATE: Decided to message her, just the casual "how you feeling?" kind of thing... She's just received it (messenger thank you), we shall find out soon, wish me luck... UPDATE2: So... I'm not sure if it's what I expected but after a bit of chatting, she seems alright. Funnily enough we have thrown a few jokes about it out there already... Still not sure what made her upset though, but she definitely seems better. Will see how the convo goes... Sitting in my car at the moment so apologies for the typing... UPDATE3: So.... Took the plunge, grew a pair, and called her... Had to find out why she was upset and make sure all was smooth. Brought up the question, she seemed a bit annoyed with herself but anyway... She said she's happy it happened, and enjoyed it, but she was upset it happened in the way it did (took us both getting drunk). Although I agree... I asked her was that it (I know we have had some form of serial tension for years... It was bound to happen but I wasn't sure this was just the reason...) So... She explained that a guy she had liked for a while (that I knew of, well I knew she talked about him a bit)... She feels she is actually falling for him and feels that me &amp; her sleeping together may of ruined this. She said she felt so guilty that she rang hin the second I left... I said to her that, she's not cheated, and all is cool between us... I encouraged her to give him a call after I hangup, she clearly likes him, I'm gutted that she feels upset with it. Ended the chat with saying I'll be there to support her regardless... And said she shouldn't feel bad because her and this guy aren't even togrther. I think she's fallen for him, and fallen hard... I feel like I've cocked this up? I'd rather just see her happy... UPDATE4: Mixed messages on here have driven me nuts. I'm going over there to find out what's actually going on in her head, hoping she can be honest to my face if she's not so far. Wish me luck. UPDATE5: Home sweet home... Right, time to sum it all up. So, some more info on the story anyway, she is at uni, lives about... 140 miles from me (when she's there), but she's home for the summer. This new guy is the guy she's spent her first year of uni, basically with. Anyway, enough of that. Finally met with her face to face. Literally just said, "Look, be honest with me, are you being truely honest with me or are you wanting me to chase you"... kinda thing. Anyway, she said she'd thought about us getting together, but it'd be too confusing (trust me, we're trainwrecks by default). We know each other inside out, quite frankly she knows my next move before I do and it scares the shit out of me. I'm not sure dating her would do either of us good, but fuck it, we'll probably end up together. She did clarify a few things for me. She feels like an asshole for asking me to leave, she thinks her step dad overheard (yikes!), and she doesn't remember some of the funny parts. Other than that, we literally just laughed about the whole thing. Laughed it off. Look guys, I appreciate those saying "She clearly wants you", but as far as I'm concerned, if she's cool with it so am I. We always get on each others nerves anyway. We'll see how her new boyfriend/maybe/whatever he is pans out, and hey ho... it might go to shit! Who knows, but at least she's being cool with the whole thing, and honestly I'm cool with it too. 
As some have pointed out, the basic wardrobe guide is now more than 2 years old. Whilst all the advice within it is sound and still relevant, it is worth updating it with new perspective and ideas. So you’ve woken up, opened your wardrobe, and decided it’s not where you want it to be. This guide is designed to help you through the murky and quite daunting task of a wardrobe overhaul. It’s important to understand that this guide is evolutionary, not revolutionary – there are basic principles to follow that will hold fast even as styles change, and many are in past guides. This is also not a shopping list, as listing items you must buy defeats the purpose of this exercise of reworking your wardrobe –you should look to find your own personal interests in style, and build upon them. You will never feel comfortable wearing clothes that don’t appeal to you. Thus, this guide is aimed at taking you through the basic principles, giving you some recommendations on what to look at (and what not to look at), and some potential ideas for you to consider. Naturally this will lean towards the casual side of things given the readership of MFA, but I have included a short business section as there are often questions regarding proms or interviews. ---- #Principles ---- Before you think about purchasing anything, there are a few concepts that you have to first understand. **Fit** The number 1 most important thing is how the clothes fit on you. Ill-fitting items will always look bad, regardless of how interesting or good-looking the garment is. Take your time to understand good fit, and you’re half way there. There are a number of principles you can follow – simple things like having the shoulder seam of clothing hitting the end of your shoulder, and having items that follow the form of your body, rather than be too restrictive or baggy. There is a sweet spot you will find. Finding an item you really like the fit of and taking its measurements will certainly be a useful tool. **I urge you to take a look at the most up-to-date fit guide in the sidebar for a deeper look into this.** Of course, there are many situations where clothing with a slouchy fit works. But here you are learning to walk before you run, so it is important to really nail good fit before bending the rules to suit your personal style – something you should build and experiment with once you have the basics down. **Simplicity** Something beginners struggle with relates to over-complicating what they are wearing. By this, I mean matching patterns and colours incorrectly, which can make any outfit jarring regardless of the fit, or buying busy items that are difficult to work with. Often, the simplest items combine together to make the best outfits. When starting out, you want to play on the idea of subtlety. Think of a slightly subdued colour palette, as these colours lend themselves towards versatility. You can pair navy, earthy greens and solid tans much more easily than you can stark reds and bright blues and yellows. That’s not to say bright colours can’t work, but again, it is worth really understanding colour-matching before utilising statement pieces. Similarly, using dark colours in a range of colour tones – black-grey-white being a classic example – are also easy to pull together into an outfit, whilst maintaining this idea of contrast that you want to create. As a general rule of thumb for beginners, it is useful to create a nice contrast between top and bottom. Darker trousers with a lighter shirt allows for a simple contrast that works well. This is a principle you can also look to for layering – slightly different tones of colour for tee and jacket make for a nice combination. Similar contrasts can be created with different textures as well – smooth cotton denim with a wool jacket for example, is a classic way of creating a subtle contrast even if the colours aren’t very different. Once understood, you can look into other colour palettes – greyscale monochrome looks are quite popular without being overly taxing to create. Beyond this you can begin to mix in patterns, textures and starker colour contrasts (or no colour contrast at all) as you begin to understand how to pair such things. Then you can move on to developing your own personal style. /u/HugAndWug has created [a useful write-up on the ---- #Building a wardrobe ---- As stated, this isn’t a shopping list but rather a way to give you some ideas on what to look for when building a basic yet versatile and wardrobe. One thing I urge you to do before plunging into this is to **take your time** – mull over items, think how they will work with your other items, and when you’re convinced of their versatility in a number of different outfits, make the purchase. This cautious approach will save you a lot of money and frustration. Let’s break the wardrobe down a little for ease of consumption. I’m assuming you live somewhere with seasons – if not, adapt where necessary. #Tops **Warm** * When the the sun is out, you want a good selection of light options. Get some solid plain crewneck tees in white, grey and natural colours, as they are a staple for layering and general wear. If you can find some with slight [texture or visual that’s also a bonus, but notice that it is still a simple item. Same for polo shirts – simple, well-fitting polos can work very well under a light jacket, and with a range of bottoms. * Grab a for something a little different to the standard tee. These are great items for layering, especially under light jackets. There’s a useful henley spreadsheet * For shirts, you can’t go wrong with some casual [oxford cloth button down shirts Neutral colours are perfect for pairing with anything from jeans to shorts. However, it’s worth looking at other options as well. Linen shirts offer a bit more [visual and are particularly good in high temperatures. They give a more relaxed and casual feel. Another good option is If you want to move away from solid colour items and have a bit more fun in the summer months, I suggest subtly patterned shirts such as a [darker or [thinly styles. These patterned items also work well as short sleeved shirts (though be aware that the fit of short-sleeve shirts needs to be spot on for it to work well). Notice that the patterns recommended are still subtle, and thus offer good versatility. **Cool** * As it gets colder, it is easier to experiment with different textures. For shirts, try out – soft and warm, these are inherently casual. They do come in solid colours, though are mostly seen in plaid patterns. See what you like – they work well in almost all casual contexts. * If you want something a little warmer, look for an overshirt. These tend to be thicker and made of heavy flannel or wool. Whilst not a necessity, it offers an alternative to a thick sweatshirt or jacket. * For an extra layer, you simply can’t go wrong with a heather grey sweatshirt or zip-up hoody. Simple but extremely versatile, and will go with practically anything for when it’s blustery or a bit cooler in the evening. With sweatshirts, you can go with any colour you see fit really, as they are a simple, throw-it-on-and-go sort of item. Just keep in mind the principles of contrast when starting out. * For something more substantial, grab a thicker wool crew neck jumper. Also available in a variety of colours, I’d suggest earthier, natural tones that generally work well in cooler times (think olives, browns, naturals, greys). These offer some interesting visual texture as well as extra warmth, but don’t overpower a simple fit. #Jackets **Warm** * There are plenty of good warm-weather jacket options. One of the best looks which pops up a lot are bomber jackets. These offer a classic silhouette that can be chucked on top of most things. These look fantastic in black and work very well in [monochromatic but also look good in [other * Similarly, a denim jacket is a solid choice. Now as a beginner, it can be easy to get this wrong – when starting out, getting a trucker style jacket that fits well, but is a different tone to your bottom half (contrasting) is a It may also help to avoid jeans when wearing one to begin with. This can also [look but learn the rules before you break them. **Cool** * You will need a cold-weather jacket. One of the best casual options is a parka, which is a slightly long, hooded rain jacket, often with insulation. It is an inherently casual option that will [go with Again, earthy tones are you’re best choice for versatility. You can also grab thinner ones for the warmer months. * I think another great and versatile option is a [dark which has the potential to [look This item works well for a beginner because it can be very easily dressed up and down, offers interesting visual texture, and will introduce you to a slightly different silhouette to which you might not be used to. It’s a chance to open up your horizons a bit. #Bottoms * With the bottom half, there are a few staples that you really do have to have, especially when starting out. First are jeans. You should look for a dark indigo pair with no distressing, as it looks clean. Focus on fit with these – try on a bunch of different pairs until you get one that fits you just right. Your preference for fit is up to you. I have quite skinny calves but am more sizeable up top, so I prefer a slim tapered silhouette. The best thing to do is try a bunch of different Levi’s cuts and find the one you find most flattering. * After solid blue jeans, you might want to look into a black pair. They’ll be virtually [just as and can allow lighter items such as white shoes or shirts an opportunity to contrast. * Chinos – you’ll never go wrong with a couple of pairs of chinos, which are flat-fronted, cotton twill trousers. My recommendation would be a navy and tan pair. These items will always come in handy casually, and are easy to dress up when the time comes. * If you want to look into some more interesting items, lighter, stonewashed jeans can be really useful in providing contrast against a [darker top and look great in the summer. However, a word of caution – fit and colour of these has to be considered carefully in order to avoid poorly distressed jeans. You want to look for a light pair with [fairly uniform distressing all in order to avoid [something like * When the temperature skyrockets, you’ll want some shorts. Buy these like you’d buy your chinos – simple, flat-fronted and versatile colours. Generally, pairs that strike above the knee look [far more than those that sit at or below. Look for shorts with a 9” inseam or less, but make sure you try them on! You’ll very much benefit from slim fitting shorts as well, which conform to the shape of your legs without restricting them. * Once you’ve nailed these, you can then start looking into options beyond a basic wardrobe, such as [wool or [slim-fitting cargo Once you are ready, you’ll understand better what direction you want to go in. #Shoes * What’s on your feet is a very crucial part of your outfit. Get it wrong and it can really kill your look. It’s important to understand that with shoes, the idea of simplicity is of paramount importance. Overly busy shoes tend to look messy unless you know what you’re doing with them. * Regarding sneakers, if you look through any recent WAYWT threads, it will become very apparent that a [simple, clean white is very easy to work into any outfit – it provides an attractive contrast on the bottom half. Grab some Vans, Converse, PF Flyers, Adidas Stan Smiths, or whatever takes your fancy – they’ll be really useful. Alternatively, another good choice are [grey Similarly easy to utilise in almost any outfit. * I think one of the best options for anyone to invest in is a good pair of leather boots. Again,to begin with, the simpler the better and easier they are to work with. However, as footwear is very subjective, I really urge you to read [this beginner’s boot buying It has practically every high quality option at different price points. If these are all above your budget (which would be understandable), take the looks from them that you do like, and seek out fast fashion options that will suit. * Regarding leather shoes, again, it is very subjective. However, you can’t go wrong with a simple [brown leather/suede These literally go with anything, [including You can find decent cheaper options from J. Crew and Bass, as well as many other fashion retailers. #Formal Often, beginners come looking for advice on suiting for interviews etc. Suiting is a different and very complex world that requires a lot of knowledge to get very right. As a result, I’m going to keep this very short, as it is investigated in far better detail elsewhere. The main principle you should understand when grabbing your first suit and wanting to look good is (as always) simplicity. Fit is imperative, and far more important than the quality of the patterns you utilise. If you are looking to make a great impression, grab a dark navy or dark grey/charcoal suit. Wear a solid white or light blue dress shirt. Pair it with a simple patterned tie in a dark colour, like a navy or forest green. Wear some simple black or dark brown [cap toe Job done. That is as basic as it gets, but it should get you started. (cont. in comments) 
Mind you, this is far from all-inclusive. These are just the jeans that I found to be readily available, not horrid looking, and don't fit like you just tied a bedsheet around your waist. Since I first wrote this list, I had a chance to get some Draggin US jeans, and found them to be fairly ugly in person. A few things to note first: - If you have only worn jeans that are &lt;$60, then you're likely used to vanity sizing (especially Levis). Be sure to measure your best fitting jeans across the waist, and compare that to the manufacturers sizing on the website. I am a size 30 in Levis, and wear a 32 or 33 in good quality jeans. The Draggin US jeans in 32 were so tight that I couldn't even button them. The Maplemoto jeans are raw, so they SHOULD be tight at first, as they will stretch. What I'm getting at is that sizing varies greatly, and you should follow the manufacturers recommendation before purchase. - This list was initially written for /r/malefashionadvice. I won't link the full list because its not AGATT friendly, but you can go find it if you feel so inclined. However, if you have questions regarding fashion relating to the jeans, or motorcycles in general, I'd be happy to help. Without further adieu, here is the list: **Denim Guide** The kevlar can be part of a denim jean in two ways: - It can be woven in with the jean, usually in a small percentage (between 10% and 20%). This will not proctect you from road rash entirely, but will hold the jeans in relative shape and help at lower speed crashes. - It can be lined with kevlar. The jeans will vary in that some are lined in contact spots (crotch, knees, ass, ankles) and some are fully lined. Fully lined jeans will obviously be safer, but will have little to no stretch. Partially lined jeans are more comfortable, but the denim needs a kevlar weave to keep that liner in place, and there is also the chance that you will get road rash where there is no liner. For the most part, the only way to get a good fittin jean will be in the partially lined jeans. So lets talk brands: - is a big name in motorcycling these days, and has quite a variety of motorcycle jeans. The fit will be good and the price will be low (&lt;$200) but you need to be careful with the specific models. Some are just Dianese-branded jeans without any armor. [They do come recommended by our Revzilla though I don't expect he'd be advertising things he doesn't sell. The good ones are woven with kevlar and have partial liners and even armor pockets (though armor is not included) - EDIT Regarding the draggin jeans below, I should have made it clearer. Draggin Australia and Drayko are the same thing. Draggin US is a different company entirely now. They no longer bear any resemblance to the Australian version. - Draggin, Draggin, and Drayko. These are a confusing mess, but can be a great value. There is [Draggin [Draggin And [Draggin Australia, US version, AKA All three make quality pants, though the Draggin American has quite a selection of dad fits and awkward washes, despite the good prices. Draggin Australia/Drayko are a very highly recommended jean, if you can get a hold of them. Prices are $150 - $200 and they are CE certified. - has recently come out with a line of slimmer fitting jeans that can actually have built in armor, though the amount of proctection is questionable, as is the price (Nearly $300) - [Lean Angle are certainly not the best looking for a slimmer guy, but are arguably some of the safest. They come fully kevlar lined with forcefield armor. Prices are reasonable for such features at $260 - makes some fully lined jeans for $250. No armor, but very stylish compared to the Lean Angle jeans. Keep in mind that Kevlar is a brand, and these are lined in Pekev, which is a very similar fabric. [Here's the - are certainly some of the better looking jeans on the list. They are woven with 16% kevlar, but have no liner. - [Sartso are another Austrailian company that makes some very nice jeans. Possibly the most affordable and best value on the list, they are usually on sale for $115. They are mostly lined, but with no weave in the denim itself. The downside is that they are hard to get a hold of, sizing and styles are limited, and the website itself kinda sucks. - [Resolute run from $150 to $250 and have some decent looking cargo stuff as well. These have no kevlar lining, but claim to be "Reinforced with genuine protective fibre technology", whatever that means. They come with armor at least. - These are the holy grail of motorcycle jeans, and will run you just shy of $500. 13oz Sanforized selvedgedenim from Cone Mills. Lined in 100% Kevlar. CE rated armor available for another $50. You won't find much better than this, as it has the best of all worlds. Only downside is the five benjamins you have to sacrifice to get them. In the end, I decided that I wanted the MapleMoto jeans, but the price was just too high. I resolved to make my own. Since I'm decent with a sewing machine, I will be adding Kevlar to my Gustin jeans. I will keep you updated as I complete that project. **ANOTHER EDIT** I'm going to add in some other recommendations that i'm getting in here: - Scorpion Converts - TDK Jeans - Mottowear - Uglybros - Aerostitch - hoodjeans - Rhok 
Drink after drink I downed at this shitty bar before he showed. Due to the size of the crowd tonight I'm assuming Holyoke was celebrating something. Shitty old club music was blasting from the sound system they had rigged up behind the bar. Judging by the wide berth I was given, everyone in this shithole knew who I was. Even before the outbreak, I'd hated bars. I was beginning to think he was purposely taunting me, he knew I needed his advice. I motioned for the bartender to come over to me. Without a word I produced a dirty old iPod from my pocket and handed it to him. "Put it on shuffle and play it." I told him. A quick about face and a few seconds later the repetitive beats were replaced by somber guitar chords. The crowd let out a collective boo and anyone who came up to the bartender was directed over to me. Nobody said anything. People started filing out of the small bar to find another place to party, all except a group of soldiers. Pearls men by the look of it; they looked angry. Great. By the time the lyrics started the soldiers were behind me. *Ain't found a way to kill me yet* *Eyes burn with stinging sweat* *Seems every path leads me to nowhere* "What makes you think you can just waltz in here and takeover this bar?" One asked. "I think it's time you'd better leave." Was all I said in reply. Then I heard him, from the far corner of the room where the pool table was. All he said was, "Duck." I ducked and narrowly avoided a suckerpunch from the drunken soldier. A twist, a grab and one face slamming against the bar later the same drunken soldier who threw the punch was face first on the table with a knife to his throat. "Not worth the time it would take to clean up," the voice in the corner said. I let go of the soldier and threw him off the table. "Leave, **now**." Was all it took for him and his buddies to stumble drunkenly out of the bar. Only then did the man in the corner step up to the bar and take a seat. Other than the cowboy hat on top of this head, he looked like he just had gotten of a motorcycle. Boots, jeans and a leather jacket. The hat darkened our his features but it was obvious whom it was, the voice was unmistakable. The perfect white teeth shining of his otherwise darkened face set me on edge, this was a new one. "BARTENDER BRING ME A DRINK!" He shouted. The bartender was completely oblivious of the yelling man. "Huh," he said, "shitty service here. Oh well, what's up?" "You know exactly why I need to talk to you." I said. "Yeah, I know, but it's nice to have a semblance of a real conversation every once and awhile." He replied. I sighed. He was being an asshole, typical. "Listen, is this even worth fighting for? Colorado, I mean." "Fuck no, pull out and regroup in California. Forget that shitty wasteland, those fuckers can have it." "Are you sure?" "Always. Let's get back to California. We have big changes to make, I have some great things planned." "Can I trust you? Can I give you control? Last time I did... Well... Someone ended up dead." "Kata? Pfft, bitch shot herself. Not my fault. She had it coming anyways. One thing though: Don't let that one bitch you have killing people slice her way too far up the ranks. People are easier to blackmail than kill." "I think it's time I get on the road. Long trip to make and all. I have a few stops to make on the way." I turned to grab my iPod and pay for my drinks. My back to the man in the hat. "One thing though," said the man in the hat, "I have a few stops of my own to make." "Wha-" I turned to ask him what he had meant but he was gone. Shit. I guess I'll have to figure out what that means on the way to California. I stood and pulled out my phone to make a call as I walked out of the bar. Three rings and a groggy voice answered the line, "Nick, it's 4AM, what the fuck?" "I know," I said, "pull everyone out of Colorado and regroup in California. We've got big plans." 
what happened yesterday. Last night I decided to get together for coffee with him, mostly because my mother urged me to. I never told her the extent of what *exactly* happened, but she knows it's video game-related because we've gone over this problem before in the past. Anyway, I initiated the conversation via text and he agreed to meet me. I guess I don't know what I was expecting. Closure, maybe? Because I was pretty sure I wanted to end it and stop trying to work things out because I've BEEN working things out for the past five years. It's just become tiring. Anyway, he got into defence mode right away, basically listing all the things *I've* done wrong in the relationship and why *he's* over *me*. These are the things I've done wrong: 1. I declined going to Korea last year for vacation. He so badly wanted to go. I knew if I went, I'd be left alone every day because his buddy would have come too. Also, there was a big LoL tournament happening at the time so he would've been doing LoL related things and mentally masturbating to the cosplayers all the time while I explored the city alone or hung out in a hotel. I said I wasn't interested in going, he got huffy but eventually got over it (or so I thought.) 2. I changed my appearance even though I knew he liked women with long brown hair. I decided to cut my hair fairly short and bleach it blond not too long ago. It was time for a change anyway, and I'm very happy with how it turned out. He was not. 3. I always refused to wear revealing clothing. He'd constantly badger me about how I don't wear enough stuff that shows off my tits and legs. I'm fairly modest, I'm not into that kinda stuff. I'm more comfortable in a t-shirt and jeans. He'd want me to wear sundresses and plunging tank tops, I always said no. 4. My birthday gift this year was a pair of those giant wrap-around headphones. Head gear. I don't know what they're called. All the Twitch streamers are wearing them. But he spent a fairly good amount of money on them. Which sounds sweet I guess, but I had originally complained that my old headphones suck, and I need new ones for the gym. He got me these bulky ones and got upset that I don't wear them much. *He's asked me in the past to wear them, put my hair in pigtails and wear revealing clothing around the house while wearing my glasses, I'm not even kidding. This guy is a major stereotype.* 5. I didn't play LoL and I didn't enjoy sitting on the couch watching him play hours of LoL. I don't how to play the game, I tried numerous times, I suck. I didn't enjoy myself. Why would I keep at it? 6. And... I was not open-minded about anything. This is pertaining to the situation in the OP. I'm not open minded enough about being his Fleshlight, so this hurt his feelings too. I'm not accepting of his kinks! Which is a total fucking lie because I've agreed to do some pretty "out there" stuff in the past to appease him. I'm very open-minded about sex. I would have appreciated a forewarning about the Twitch girl joining us in bed though. 7. I don't get along with his friends. I tried to, SO HARD. I tried to relate to those guys like you wouldn't believe. But they all literally have zero social skills, they're awkward and blatantly ignored my existence whenever I was around. They'd start talking about things *they're* interested in and just disregard anything I ever said. They'd invite him to board game nights, asking if *I'd be going too* like they don't want me there. I was pretty much an outcast. So no, I tried. They just didn't want to be around me. So, in conclusion... I told him I was done. He didn't really react dramatically. I think he's done with the relationship too. He can watch all the Twitch he wants now and play LoL for 23 hours of the day! That must be quite a relief. I'm going to the apartment to pick up whatever I can later. I'm staying with my parents until I find a new place. I feel oddly calm and okay with everything that's gone down in these last couple days. This is almost a relief. Thanks everyone. TLDR: Broke up with boyfriend. He thinks I'm scum for a number of reasons. I'm okay with it. 
I thought I'd show you this, from top to bottom, my jeans from 2013, my jeans from 2014, and the jeans I bought yesterday: 
I'm a second time dog owner, first time shiba owner. I've had my dog Lucy for 9 months now (got as a puppy). Shes a pretty independent dog and that's kind of what I wanted. She doesn't need to be held all the time need or us to be interacting with her which is nice IMO. And she's been pretty good until recently. She has recently started hoarding an object (usually a dog treat/bone) and if you go near her she'll definitely bite you, HARD. We hand feed her and constantly let her know that humans/hands are where food comes from but she just looses her mind every once in a while and just go nuts. Usually if I can remove the thing she's guarding from her she'll calm down in an hour or two. I watched some of ceasars vids on how to deal with aggresive dogs and have tried some of his techniques, but I just get bit a tonne. I wear jeans and usually some shin guards underneath and am careful to keep my hands and arms away. Last time I indirectly slowly inched towards her(calm and assertive) but she would just attack me. I tried out-waiting her, she would appear to calm down and lay down but the second I so much as shifted my weight from side to side she'd be biting my legs again. We don't give her any treats now only her normal dog food. We've found she's more likely to be aggressive if we take her for a longish walk on a hot day so we keep the walks on an energy expenditure basis and try not to totally exhaust her. Its hard to get help from dog trainers because we can't replicate the behaviour for them. The only thing she is afraid of is my hockey stick, but I've swear it's done nothing to warrant that control(no beating her or anything). Its only one particular stick which is strange because I have quite a few but the others don't bother her. The worst part of it is we get no warning. She'll be totally relaxed one minute and without a warning growl or bark; attacking the next. I'm at a loss as how to address this behaviour, and am tired of being bit. I have a new child and will absolutely not let them near each other. This dog is a danger to adults and would be lethal to a child. I'll never get another shiba and highly recommend others to avoid the breed as well. She's the best/most fun, great tempered dog 99% of the time but I can't deal with the unpredictability of her aggression. As a note we've had her checked by the vet and they can't identify any sickness or anything. 
At fifteen I fell in love with my best friend. Josephine, or Jo as I called her, lived across the street from me. She moved in when we were both ten or so and we hit it off pretty quickly. If you thought of a tomboy, she would most likely be the image you got. One could even be forgiven for thinking she was a boy with a short ponytail from a distance. Few would call her stunning, but over time I found myself seeing her in a different way than when we were younger and spent out time catching salamanders and cray fish in the stream. She loves sports, loves going on adventures and there are few things she wouldn’t try once. I loved her adventurous nature, one that I wished I had. She also had her troubles. Her mother left her father and her which was why they moved into my town, a shitty little mountain town in Pennsylvania. As our friendship grew I noticed that she was alone a lot of the time, spending hours in the woods behind her house while her father worked two jobs to keep a roof over their head. She was very protective of that patch of woods, even I wasn’t allowed near there unless she said so. Everyone in that town had money troubles, but Jo and her dad were worse off by far. My parents even gave her some of the clothes I outgrew. And while times were tough, I learned later that she wasn’t really that alone. A warm June day of my fifteenth year found us on the banks of the local river, watching it’s muddy brown water sparkle in the sunlight. We had spent the better part of an hour swinging off a rope into the middle of the river and swimming back. Our clothes were hung on branches as we laid on rocks in our underwear, trying to dry some before riding home. I stole glances at her and the image of her lying beside me, with her tan skin speckled with water and her black hair matted to her head, stays with me still. She caught my look and gave me a raised eyebrow. “What’s up?” She rose up on her elbows. “Nothing.” I took up a stone and skipped it out into the water. “What’s next for today?” She sat up and pulled her knees to her chest. “Got plans this afternoon. You?” “Plans?” She was frowning when I looked over. “What you doing?” “Got a date.” I felt my heart drop and splash in my gut. She couldn’t meet my eyes and I suspect she knew I had feelings for her then, but didn’t want to acknowledge it. “Dave asked me out yesterday.” I nodded as it was all I could manage. I felt like someone had sucker punched me. “Cool. If he gives you any shit you let me know.” “I can take care of him if he gets out of line, but backup is always nice.” She stood and pulled her t-shit off a branch and slipped it on. “What are you gonna do?” “Probably go home and play the SNES. Nothing much to do around here on your own.” “Sorry.” She said while tying her wet hair into a pony tail. “For what? I’m more then capable of entertaining myself.” “Aren’t most boys?” “Wow. Really? *Really?* That’s low, Jo.” “Just calling it like I see it. Anyway, I’ll catch you later.” She laughed and placed a hand to my head as she walked past me and then went up the bank, disappearing into the brush and short trees. I sat there for a long time, listening to the birds call across the gap of the river and the sound of fish bubbling up to the surface and thought about how much of a dumb ass I was. Finally, after ripping myself to shreds mentally, I got up to leave. The hair on the back of my neck perked up and a shiver run across my spine. I stopped mid turn and looked back at the river. The feeling of being watched is always uncomfortable, but when surrounded by trees that created heavy shadows in their depths, the feeling is far worse. The birds had stopped their chirping too and it felt like everything had gone still. I waited, my breath slow and my eyes clicking from side to side as I looked for the source of the feeling. Nothing. I saw nothing, but the feeling stayed with me as I trudged up the bank. It didn’t leave until I reached the road and hopped on my bike. I rode home and spent the day inside playing video games. Jo didn’t come around for a few days and calling always got the answering machine. I decided to go over to her place, but knocking on the front door gave no answer. Their spare key was hid at my house but I didn’t think it would be a good idea to just walk in. Still, I worried about her. As I walked back across the street I noticed a group of five guys coming up the street, a soccer ball being kicked between them. One of them raised a hand to me. Joey. I didn’t get along with most of the other guys that were in town which is why I think Jo and I became friends so fast, but Joey was always cool with me. He tapped the ball back to the group and jogged over to me, his soccer cleats loud on the pavement. “Hey man,” he said, his breath still light. He swallowed hard and wiped sweat from his forehead. “Missed a great game this afternoon.” “It’s like ninety, how many passed out this time?” “Only three… no wait, four. We brought a shit-ton of water this time. You need to come play, you can be goalie.” “Done that before, Joey. Never again.” He laughed, patted my shoulder. “It’ll be different this time, besides we could have used another player since Dave didn’t show up.” “He didn’t?” “Nah, went over to his house, place is up for sale.” Joey looked down the road and scratched at the back of his head. “He didn’t mention anything about moving.” “When did you last see him?” Joey thought for a moment and then cocked his head to the side. “Few days ago, I think. Talked shit about a date with somebody.” He grinned. “Guess it went really south.” I nodded and Joey soon went on his way. I decided to take a walk down to Dave’s to see for myself. Sure enough, the sign was out front and the place looked empty. The windows were covered over and even from the front porch I couldn’t see much of anything. Something strange was going on and I felt even more worried about Jo. Did she move too, without telling me? Did something happen on their date? Maybe they went into witness protection. That would be pretty cool, save for the whole not seeing her anymore part. I went home, trying to come to terms with the idea that I may have lost my best friend. That night something pelted off my bedroom window. I was awake, unable to sleep with a mind full of questions, and it startled me from my bed. I crept over to the window and peered down into the lake of darkness below. Something moved down there and another pebble whacked off the window. I opened it up and stuck my head out. “Who the hell is that?” “Its me.” Jo whispered and stepped closer to the house so the porch light could catch her thin frame. “Can you come out?” “Where have you been?” “Just come out, I’ll tell you what I can.” She stepped back into the darkness and I went to searching for a pair of pants and a clean shirt. After a few minutes of quiet sneaking, so as not to wake my parents, I stepped out into a misty summer evening and shivered at the chill. “Jo?” I started down the walkway, searching either side. She appeared from behind a tree and motioned to me. “You better explain to me what’s going on. You witness a murder or something?” “What? What makes you think that?” She took my hand as she spoke and led me off onto the road. Once there she turned to me and pulled me into a tight hug. “God, I missed you.” “Missed you too, so tell me why you disappeared.” She released me and took a few steps back, looking almost sheepish. “Can’t… I mean, not entirely. Something kinda big is going on, but I’m gonna protect you, so don’t worry.” “Protect me? Jo, what are you going on about?” She stared at the ground and then licked her lips. “Jeeze, didn’t think it would be this hard. You trust me, right? Like, with your life?” “Jo—“ “All right, before you get all annoyed, just listen. Dave is gone…” “I know, I saw the for sale sign.” I said and glanced back down the road. “What happened on that date of yours? He cop a feel and you killed him?” She laughed, but there was no humor in it. “No, he was a gentleman, but he wasn’t what I wanted.” She started to pace, her hands in the back pockets of her jeans. “I hope I didn’t read this wrong, I’m still getting the hang of… it, but there’s something here, right? Between us, I mean… and like, it’s more than friends. It’s not just me that feels that… right?” I felt my mouth drop and found no words to say. A large part of me was sure I miss heard her and so I just stammered for a few seconds before she reached out and tapped my chin. “Just yes or no, that’s all I need.” I swallowed hard, amazed at how dry my throat felt and how hollow my lungs were. With a deep breath I nodded and said, “Yes.” She grinned, a look of happiness that I had never seen before. She moved to me, placed her hands on either side of my face and kissed me. It was just as I expected my first kiss would be: sloppy, wet and amazing. I started to kiss her too and soon after she broke it off and took a step back. “You got no idea how long I wanted to do that.” “Oh, I think I got a good idea… yeah.” I said and opened my eyes to see her grinning at me. We stood silent in the night, the moonlight playing off us both. I had so many questions but chose the most pressing one. “But if you feel this way, why date Dave?” Her lips tighten and thinned. “If we… if this is something we want, I need to get in good with my mom.” “In good with your mom? What does that have to do with Dave? I thought your mom abandoned you and your dad.” She sighed. “Should be truthful in relationships, that’s what all the talk shows say…” She seemed to say this more to herself than for my benefit. “I can’t, not yet. Just trust me that you’re safe in all that’s going down and that I’m doing it for us.” “What *are* you doing?” I reached out for her but she moved away and glanced to the tree line behind her house. “Jo?” “This has gone too long already. I just wanted you to know that I’m okay. In a few days I’ll come by and we can really talk.” She moved toward me again and gave me a quick peck on the cheek before running off to her house. It was days later that I started to notice something. A lot of homes were going up for sale and a lot of the guys that use to hang around had strangely gone missing. The girls were still around and seemed just as confused as I as to why so many were moving. Jo’s name kept showing up too, usually in connection with boys having a date or something with her. That part left me lost, not only because she seemed to be into me, but that so many guys would go out with her. Like I said, she was a tomboy and I remember most of the guys would make fun of her looks behind her back. They never wanted anything to do with her before. In the end, six homes were left empty. The last one I saw while in the front seat of my mom’s car on the way home from the store. As we passed I noticed that the person putting the sign up was not just any random guy, but Jo’s father. I realized then I had no idea what her dad did, but it felt strange that her father was there. I started to fear exactly what Jo had going on. No one had any idea the families were moving and no one could recall a moving truck, or even seeing the families move stuff. It was like they just flat out disappeared from the face of the earth. What could do that? I wondered a lot those few days and wondered even more when I realized I was the last boy of my age around. Even Joey had gone. Almost a week passed since I'd seen Jo that night. Then one day there was a knock on the back door where my family had a little rec room. It was where my gaming stuff was and a lot of my old toys. I was there working my way through Final Fantasy 2 as it had been raining all day. I hit pause and got up. Through the windows I could see Jo, drenched and looking tried and worried. When I opened the door she came in quickly and pulled me into another hug, soaking me. “Jesus, Jo!” I shuddered as the cold water shocked me. She pulled away, grinning wide. “It’s finished. You’re safe now.” “Safe? Have you seen what’s been going on? Everyone is moving out of here. Joey was gone yesterday, not a word and then I see your dad out there putting a for sale sign in the front yard. When did he start selling homes?” “Few months ago, he finally got his license.” “What has been going on? You know why everyone is leaving, don’t you?” She nodded, a solemn expression coming over her. “I do, yeah. If there was another way I’d have done it.” “What have you done?” “It’s mom. I told her about my feelings for you and she… wasn’t happy to say the least.” I pulled her to sit with me on the broken and worn couch. “When did your mom show up?” “She’s never really been gone.” She started to fuss with the edge of her jacket. “She’s not a normal woman and I had to do a few things for her to get her blessing. My dad is okay with me and you, but she didn’t like it as she had her own plans. So, I’ve done as she asked and she has one more request. Will you come with me? If you do, you’ll have your answers.” She was my best friend, the love of my life, how could I say no? Fear and anxiety were getting a good hold of me by then, but I’d do almost anything for Jo. So, I stood and she did the same. She led the way across the street to her house while the rain slowed to just a patter on the pavement. I thought we were going inside, but she continued on down the driveway and then cut through the backyard and to the trees. She paused outside for me to catch up and then took my hand. We stepped in together. A few yards in I noticed a smell. Woods tend to smell different in wet weather, but this wasn’t anything like that. The smell could only be described as putrid. I glanced around our surroundings, expecting to see a swamp or something of that sort. There were none and the further we went into the woods, the worse it got. I noticed the woman standing at the base of a very large tree that was covered in what looked like ropes. Around her were tables of varying heights and were made from bark covered logs. Beyond her looked to be a cave that had been dug into the side of a small cliff. She was very tall, at least two feet higher than me. She reminded me of a bird in how she stood. She had her long fingers folded atop each other and while I couldn’t see her eyes due to her bushy brown hair, I knew she watched every move I made. “Is—is that her?” I asked and Jo squeezed my hand. “Don’t run, no matter what.” “Why would I run.” “You’ll want to, I know. Just don’t let go of my hand.” She dragged me forward and into the clearing where the tables were set up. The smell somehow was worse here. It didn’t take much to find the source, the tables were covered with fresh and dried blood, like someone had butchered a hundred animals on them. Bones littered the floor and crackled under my feet as Jo pulled me to stand beside her and in front of the woman. “This is my mom.” Jo said and held a hand out to the woman. “Mom, you know who this is. I’ve done all you’ve asked.” The woman took a few steps forward. I felt my breath catch deep in my lungs when I saw that her feet were backwards. Not broken, but turned completely around to face the other direction. Because of this she walked almost like the bird she reminded me of. I started to back away, but Jo’s grasp of my hand was iron-like. “What’s going on here?” “You’re all right. I didn’t tell you this before, but my mother has always been here. She couldn’t really live with us though because she’s… well, people call her kind Ciguapa.” “What is that?” Jo moved in front of me, blocking the view of her mother and took both my hands in hers. “I didn’t think you’d know what that was. She’s basically a myth, an urban legend in the Dominican where she’s from. She met my dad when he visited there years ago and for the first time she fell in love. Because of that, she didn’t kill him and instead they fell in love and moved back here.” “Kill him?” “I know, it’s a lot to take in. She’s not bad, no more so than a lion is bad. It’s just her nature and she can’t survive on the food we eat.” I dropped to the ground, my mind racing along with my heart. I felt sick and puked between my legs and onto the wilting brown leaves and yellow chips of bone. Jo came down with me and wiped the bile from my lips with her thumb. “I think you know what she does eat.” “People.” She smiled ruefully. “Men mostly, and boys sometimes.” “I don’t understand this. Are you—are you like her?” “Would you hate me if I was?” She shook her head, obviously not wanting an answer. “I am a bit like her. You see her as she is, just as you do with me, but many males… they see what they want to see. It’s how she lures her food, like a Venus flytrap, I guess.” “People aren’t flies!” She ran her hands over my cheeks and shushed me. “No, I didn’t mean to say they were.” She paused, as if choosing her next words carefully. “I love you. She wanted to come after you next, but I couldn’t let that happen so I did what she asked. I brought her enough food that she wouldn’t even think of looking at you that way.” “The guys? The families that moved…?” Jo nodded slowly. “I had no choice, not if I wanted to be with you. Not if I didn't want you... I’m sorry.” “Joey too? Dave?” “Yes.” I pinched myself in hopes of waking up, but no such luck. My best friend was still knelt in front of me and a strange woman stood behind her. From the woman came three loud chirps, they sounded like an old woman trying to imitate a nightingale. “No, you promised. He has to understand and I’ll answer any question he has.” The woman chirped again. “He won’t.” “Do you…” I gulped. “I mean, did you eat pieces of them?” Jo shook her head hard. “No. No, like I said, I’m not exactly like her. I’m half human and half Ciguapa. My feet are normal, I eat normally, but I can appear differently from person to person.” “Why… why am I here?” I wanted to cry just to relieve the fear and insanity that felt like it would overwhelm me. “She wanted to meet you.” The woman chirped again and came around Jo. I looked up to find black eyes staring down at me. “She wanted to make sure that you love me as much as I love you.” “If I don’t?” Jo stood silently. She looked down at me and bit her bottom lip. “I know you do.” Her mother reached out and placed a bony hand on top of my head and bent down in front of me, grinning to show pointed teeth. She stayed there just long enough for her pale face to be burnt into my nightmares and then she stood. She went to a table and picked up what looked like a hunk of meat and tore off a piece and began to eat. “So? Are you satisfied?” The woman munched thoughtfully and then gave a small chirp. “Really? Can we go then? I don’t think he can take much more right now.” Jo didn’t wait for an answer and instead came over and picked me up. We started out of the woods, Jo supporting me because my limbs didn’t seem to work anymore. I think I passed out because the next thing I remember was being in my room. Jo laid beside me, asleep. It was the middle of the night and as I laid there I could hear night birds chatting away. Or perhaps, it was her mother. Jo and I married a few years later, after college. I’ve never seen her mother again, but I swear she still watches us from time to time. I get the same feeling as I got that day on the river bank. Jo is pregnant now and I worry that the baby may take after her mother’s side of the family. She has already been having cravings for meat, but no meat from the store seems to help as she says it tastes disgusting and the baby gets upset. I don’t know what to do. I had hoped this was all behind us, like a bad nightmare. I’ve contacted her dad. He’s still a Realtor. I’ll do anything for Jo. She’s my best friend, the love of my life and soon, the mother of our child. 
Now, I'm not saying I fit into them well. Or maybe I am. I don't know. She's pretty small, about 125 lbs. Started at 245 lbs in March. Down to 193. Goal = 175. [Me and all of the glory that is tight girl 
Im moving to Melbourne in a couple of month and i was wondering if you guys could give me some info on South Yarra and things to see and do in Melbourne also what do you guys wear? I know it gets cold but how cold? I live in QLD now which mean i don't even own a pair of long jeans :D would i need a winter coat? I've never been to Melbourne and i don't know anybody down there so would appreciate you help :) 
I've got an interview on Friday afternoon. The company is relatively formal generally, suits etc, but classicly dressed down on a Friday (think chinos and brogues rather than jeans). What should I wear for the interview? Full suit/tie? Go for the standard smart casual dressed down look? Something in between? Thanks for any any tips. Edit. Unanimous. Suit and tie it is. Thanks everyone. 
So, I'm a poor kid from West Virginia and I've always admired raw denim, scrolling through this sub is bitter-sweet. Everybodies got fly ass jeans I can't afford.. So the man pops out of nowhere and throws me my first pair after posting in a thread here on Reddit. I don't think a pair of jeans has ever really touched me like this, the fit is perfect, the quality is superb. I've been wearing American Eagle jeans because of the fades and low cost.. I'll never go back. I can't thank the guys at Gustin enough, and I don't think I'm ever going back to department store pants. This has made my entire year. I know that sounds silly, but coming from a spot with no jobs, and some serious drug problems all around me, backwoods hood life.. Something like this is a ray of hope, and shows me that people truly are generous and kind. Major thanks to the sub-reddit for showing me the way to step my jean game up, and to Gustin for being a stand up company. They have a customer for life with me. 
After 3 months of treating my latest pair of Levi's with kid gloves, (hand washing, NEVER wearing them on long walks) they've already broken down and gotten their typical hole in between the thighs. Between 9 months being the longest I can remember keeping a pair of jeans hole-free and the desire to have functional pockets for once in my life, I'm done with this bullshit. Financially, I'm in no position to drop a couple hundred dollars to get a pair of jeans with durable denim and usable pockets custom made, so are there any ladies here who have found a decent-fitting pair of mens' jeans? Skinny and slim fit look best on me, and being just under 5'8" finding the right length won't be a problem, but I'm of average weight with an hour-glass body type, so I worry about finding mens' jeans to accommodate my very un-manly butt, hips and small waist. Any recommendations? 
This is (most likely will stay) a throw away account because some friends use Reddit, and a certain female mentioned might use it, but I really don't know. So I'll start this by saying it unsurprisingly didn't happen today, but back when school was still going on. Also, dont really know if this is NSFW. Anyways I was sitting in class going over my textbook since I didn't have anything to do. I let my mind wander to things like what fashion souls I would go with for my new falchion/spear build in Dark Souls 2, that I should play more cs go and actually get out of silver (nova one now, but that's hardly better), and, well, girls. Specifically a girl I had/have a crush on (that's a completly different FU). Now this next thing may seem uncommon for a teenage boy, but believe it or not, I got aroused. I know, unheard of! It was no problem I had some jeans on so I could kinda just sit upright so it didn't look like I had a “tent pitched for one.” Now I'm guessing you can tell where this is going. I was sitting there and I think there was only a few minutes left in class. Then the fire alarm went. And that was quite nerve wracking. So I have no choice but to go with the class. You can't just hold a book casually to cover up, or delay since even though it's just a drill, its timed and you don't get to wait around in class, and the tent, if you will, wasn't going away anytime soon. It was an awkward hovel outside, trying to keep one foot higher so there was more of a crease in the jeans so it wouldn't reveal the truth. Once outside we headed to the field in the back and lined up as our classes. As well, we lined up alphabetical and I was in the back, sounds alright, but I was maybe three people away from my crush, bad. I just stood there sometimes moving my shirt and trying to pull it down, probably drawing attention to myself in the long run. Once we could go back in, I continued the awkward hovel back hoping no one had noticed, and I still don't know if I was obvious enough for people to know. I went back to the class, grabbed my books and went to our next block. Still embarrassed as hell without even knowing if anyone noticed. Well, that's it, don't know if it was a huge FU, but still humiliating for me, even though again, it may have been that no one actually saw. TL;DR got aroused by a fire alarm (not really) 
I am a cisgendered woman, and I'm curious about the ways in which any of you who have transitioned or are transitioning deal with gender roles. I'm assuming this is personal and will be a bit different for everyone. I ask this from the point of view that gender roles have changed a lot over the past decades. Workplace equality, relationship dynamics, parenting roles... it's all come a long way! But while many aspects of society are quite equal and not restricted to "male" or "female," there are still a lot of behaviours and fashions that are imposed on you based on your gender. For example, in my relationship, my husband (cisgender male) cooks, can sew on a button and has changed more diapers than me (we don't have kids). I am the breadwinner. And when cuddling, we are equally comfortable being the big or little spoon. BUT socially, I still feel out of place when I don't shave my armpits. If I wear baggy (and very comfortable!) jeans, I feel "fat" and somehow less feminine. I feel a certain pressure to be "sexy." I often find myself watching other women to see if I'm enough like them to fit in. If I, as a cisgender woman, sometimes feel restricted by the social expectations on my gender, I expect that anyone who is transgender would feel it doubly so. What social pressures stand out to you most? Are there any gender-specific social roles that appeal to you in particular? Sorry if this was long. And if anything I'm asking is insensitive PLEASE let me know so I can fix it. 
These are smallest-size jeans I've ever worn as an adult! I'm pretty excited :) [The 
1st: Just look at that young person with the short hair and blue jeans. Is it a boy or a girl? 2nd: It's a girl. She's my daughter. 1st: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I didn't know that you were her father. 2nd: I'm not. I'm her mother. 
After a couple years of being adamant about leg day, my baggy jeans are now skinny jeans, and my skinny jeans are now jorts. Most jeans I found at the mall that fit me around the thighs are a turrible bootcut and I didn't want to mess with getting anything tailored. A lot of you probably already know about these, but if not, go to and buy 541's, their 'athletic fit'. Right now. I just ordered my normal size, and they fit better than any pair I've worn. This might make me sound like I just bought stock in Levi's, but I didn't. I promise. Happy lifting!

Hello Riot, Please stop putting casters into this uncomfortable position. If there is anyone who studies communication, etc. should tell you that having people standing on spot and just talking to the camera will look strange, and weird. Take a look on some positions they are using and there were many more, just cant find anywhere VOD. SO please make them stand behind the table or give them something into hands at least that they can hold and not to stand there awkwardly. EDIT: Happy to see post trending. I did not want to offend anyone with this post, I just did not feel comfortable watching these parts of stream. As one of the guys pointed out, this is definitely also cultural difference, and everyone can perceive it differently. Maybe casters felt just ok casting like this. Next thing is I did not mean that they have to sit while casting. I know that casting is easier in standing position, but you still need to feel comfortable. And also agree that those jeans and suit didnt really look professional. But, I liked monte's style :)

Bought my normal size/brand of jeans I usually buy; 40s Levi's. Since I always buy those I don't try them on at the store. Put them on at home and has a noticeable bagginess. I love these jeans so I hope they have them in the same color.

WHAT. Granted, they are size 15/16 skinny jeans (that fit very well on my size 11-12 frame so it must be the brand), but... I managed to get my legs into SKINNY. JEANS. Repeat after me. Skinny jeans. They aren't tight, they fit me great, and holy crap I'm wearing skinny jeans. Thanks keto, I love you. KCKO :) 
hi guys, so me and my girlfriend have been seeing each other for a while, and we've had plenty of steamy make out sections. Tonight was a little different. She's fine with me fondling her boobs, and sucking on them, but shes not comfortable with any vaginal play (which I'm fine with) Well long story short tonight we were making out in her bed, when she layed on her back, pulled me on top, and wrapped her legs around me. We both had pants on but she was shirtless. As we did our thing she was getting into it more and more. Eventually I was grinding into her (we're both wearing jeans) and she's getting fairly into it (moaning, pulling at my shirt, etc) Eventually she stops kissing me altogether, and is just breathing really heavy. At this point I just buried my face in her neck and kept going to town. After 30 seconds or so of me grinding her quite hard, she pretty much latched onto me as hard as she could for several seconds, before she finally relaxed, and we went back to gentle kissing. Am I missing something? Or did she actually get off? I'm sorry for immense detail, but I've never had a girl orgasm fully clothed from grinding before, and I'm confused. Thanks for any help! 
Throwaway because boyfriend knows my Reddit account. BF and I are both 19 and we have been dating for three years. Tonight I went over to his house to play some Steam games (I finally got a job and decided to play some games that he recommended), and he wants to test them out on his new laptop. He decides to show me Surgeon Simulator. Having had brain surgery a few times, I am absolutely terrified of anything having to do with my noggin organ. But I say oh fuck, why the hell not. It's cartoonish, right? No big deal. After a nutritious dinner of corn dogs fresh from the oven, I turn my head and he says "Hey, Nora, look." I turn and he has the poor patient's brain lolling about the tool tray and the screen is positively spurting with blood. I manage to vomit all over his new laptop, his jeans, and his carpeting. (The dog managed to move away). He projectile vomits into my hair. Reddit, TIFU bad. EDIT: Jesus fuck, Reddit. Front page. I love you. 
So I was getting ready to leave the house about 10 minutes ago and I sat down to play one last game of Hearthstone, when I suddenly feel a sharp pain in my inner right thigh. I stood up and felt around until I felt a lump on the INSIDE of my jeans, and another sharp sting and that's when I realised - there was a fucking beetle in the inside of my pants biting into me. I'm incredibly scared of physical contact with bugs and go absolutely apeshit, I'm tearing away at my pants trying to open the buttons and eventually end up tearing the fabric and half the buttons to get them down and pull this bug out - and it turns out it was a piece of gum that had somehow found its way onto my thigh and gathered up a good portion of the hair off my skin and my moving around was only causing it to pull out more. Now I need to put on another pair of pants and go for an exam anyway in 15 minutes. Tl;DR gum causes hair loss

I generally wear Iron Rangers with raw denim and a t-shirt--I can't afford a leather jacket, but still need something to keep me warm this fall. What sort of denim jacket can I get that would give off that "Americana" look without falling short? Should it be lighter? Darker? Doesn't matter as long as the color doesn't match the jeans? 
Let's assume they are on identical bikes and their frontal profile is identical (which is obviously unlikely but it makes life easier) so air resistance is not a factor. Will the heavier rider have done exactly twice the work add the lighter rider? Logic tells me that the potential energy of the heavier rider should be double that of the lighter rider, but I didn't do physics at school, so I could well be wrong. If both riders were running a power meter (powertap, quarq etc) well that show double the work having been done? And what is the appropriate measurement for that? Watt hours? -----EDIT----- Thanks for the great answers everyone. I didn't expect this to hit the front page - this is my first ever post to Ask Science. I posted it a few days ago and it got deleted - I pored over the submission rules to see what had gone wrong but it had just got caught in the spam filter - and now here it is on the front page! Submitted it when I went to bed and woke up to 400 odd comments - am working through them now. And to everyone who said it wouldn't be double due to bike weight you are absolutely right. I should have had a 50kg rider and a 110kg rider both on 10kg bikes. But that is why I don't even science, bro. 
I'm a short person (5'3") and I needed some new jeans so I got two stretch jeans and got them hemmed from 34 to 28.5 inseam. The length is decent to cuff with but I feel like hemming them again. I don't have the receipt anymore, am I able to get them hemmed again? Also, the jeans are skinny fit but I feel like with hemming, they're on the wider side because the ankle area with more taper gets hemmed off. Is this inevitable when hemming? 
For those who don't know about it, tailored jeans for $55. Decent range of colours and styles. I feel like this is some kind of Melbourne "lifehack" FB Page: 
PICS: Was in Syndey at the weekend and went to visit Corlection in Haymarket. Great shop, the staff were very knowledgeable and accommodating. They have some super cool stuff, esp. Real Japan Blues and Strike Gold, but for a while I'd been interested in Pure Blue Japan. The fit on my other pairs is pretty relaxed so I went for something slimmer this time; enter the XX-015 model in one-wash. **DENIM** 14oz left-hand twill. Indigo warp/white weft. From all the incredible jeans at Corlection, the denim on the PBJs was the most appealing. The texture appears very rough but it's quite comfortable to wear. Honourable mention to the SGs with the brown weft, those were sweet. **DETAILS** Love that patch design, the leaf embroidery and the blue selvedge ID. They are plain jeans but those small details differentiate them really well. See photos for hidden rear rivets as well as pocket bag. **FIT** I ended up with a size 29, same as my Fullcounts. According to the Corlection staff, these are a higher rise version of the XX-013, which is a slim tapered cut. They certainly are slim through the rise and thighs, but that's actually what I wanted and I think they work on me. They need hemming, not sure if I should wait until after the first wash or proceed immediately given that they are one-wash. All in all, I'm stoked to have them and it was great to be able to get a feel for so many well-regarded denim brands side by side to see what I actually like the look and feel of in person as opposed to through a screen. Brands I really thought I'd love (SDA, RJB), I didn't find as appealing as what I ended up with. SG was the other standout but the fabric is a bit intimidating in terms of actually wanting to wear it. My way of fading jeans is closer 'gently ageing' rather than 'actively thrashing for siq fades' so those pics will be a while coming yet. 
I just saw this on /r/rowing, and thought some of you ladies might be interested since there's often conversations about jeans not fitting on here. [Barbell Apparel bring out 'anti-thigh gap' jeans for people with muscly thighs and I wish a) that these had been available when I was a competitive rower and had to buy larger jeans and concertina them at the waist with a belt to fit my (comparatively) massive quads in to the legs; and b) that they sold them in the UK. 
Close your eyes and think about all the doors you pass through each day. Hundreds of doors, thousands in your lifetime. Breezing in and out, you probably think of them as nothing more than a means to an end, a way to get from point A to point B. Doors with handles, doors that glide open electronically when you step in the right place, doors that creak and groan with age and remind you to pick up WD-40 next time you’re at the store. But some doors are different. Some doors are not meant to be traveled through. Quite the opposite. Some doors are built to prevent people, or even things, from getting in. Some doors are built to keep things from getting out. I’m not a believer in the paranormal. I don’t put stock in ghosts or demons or monsters. The things that go bump in the night? I generally think they all have some explanation, one way or another. The human brain is an easily frightened, painfully irrational organ. When others stand shaking at the tops of dark basement stairwells, peering into the damp black, I charge ahead, straight to the bottom. Leaky pipes and cobwebs in corners don’t frighten me -- why should they? So when my mother told me she felt like something was off in the basement of her newly inherited home, I laughed. She was always chattering about her fantasies, ghosts and vampires and angels. She claimed that I felt the spirits, too, and I would open my eyes someday to see. I raised an eyebrow and reminded myself one of these days I was going to miss the sound of her voice when she told me her ghost stories. I had driven four hours across the state to help her move cardboard box after cardboard box from a rental storage unit into the house. Well, I call it a house, but it was more like a cottage with its oddly shaped living room, cramped little bedroom with an attached bath, and galley kitchen. The great aunt who had lived there before was a spinster with no love for any living being, save her cats. She had taken good care of the place, though, and for some reason given thought to passing the property on to her sister’s daughter rather than one of her own children or grandchildren. My mother’s financial troubles had made it impossible for her to rent more than a single room in a boarding house over the last decade after her last child left the nest, so it was exciting for all of us that she now had a stable place of her own to live. “I just get the strangest feeling when I go down there, like something wants me out,” she told me, talking a mile a minute as we worked through boxes of kitchen paraphernalia. Her tendency to hoard over the years had caught up with her in this place -- I made a mental note to smuggle a few boxes of junk out when I left and dump them at a local Goodwill. We had spent the morning working on her bedroom and rays of midafternoon light were now streaming through the high windows in the cottage’s western-facing wall. The yellow and green floral pattern of the kitchen wallpaper seemed to brighten in the sun, creating a cheery, cozy atmosphere. I couldn’t imagine a single thing about this place making anyone feel ill at ease. “Sounds to me like you’re just trying to get me to carry these boxes of canning supplies down there on my own,” I teased. She laughed, a slight edge to her mirth that gave me pause. I could tell from the way her brow knit that she was serious. A pang of guilt rippled through me. I hadn’t been around much in the past few years, and I knew she was lonely and tired of being alone. She was likely experiencing some apprehension at the thought of living here all by herself, apprehension that I was now poking fun at. What a great daughter I made. I placed a comforting hand on her shoulder, trying not to wince at the feeling of bone just below her skin. The increased fragility that betrayed her aging was an all-too-real reminder of her mortality. Even though the women in our family typically lived into their 80s and 90s, giving my mother another possible few decades, I was increasingly aware that she was no longer the immortal superwoman I had grown up loving. As thoughts of her inevitable death flashed through my brain, I pulled her in for a close hug. “Oh!” She squeaked, setting down the crock pot lid she had been examining for cracks before wrapping her arms around me. No matter how old you are, there’s nothing quite like a hug from your mom. After a few quiet moments, I pulled back and kissed the top of her forehead. Grabbing up the box of canning supplies, I asked for directions to the basement entrance. “You walked all over it this morning,” she told me. I followed her directions and found the seam for the trap door on the bedroom floor, just a few feet from the foot of her queen-size bed. I set the box down on the quilted bedspread and bent down to get a good grip on the wood and lift it up slowly. The trap door revealed a set of weathered but sturdy-looking stairs, leading down into the inky darkness under the house. Cool air drifted up from the subterranean room, and I breathed in the familiar basement smells of must and damp. “Is there a light switch somewhere?” I called to the kitchen. “Not until you get down to the bottom. There’s a bulb with a string right overhead when you reach the ground.” “Great,” I muttered. “Let’s hope I don’t break my neck on the way down.” Grabbing the box and being careful to leave the trap door open completely to let in as much light as possible, I began slowly making my way down the stairs. The staircase had no railings or wall to lean against, so I relied on my less-than-fabulous balancing skills and luck to reach the bottom without tripping. The temperature change as I descended was drastic, and I found myself shivering a little in my lightweight summer clothes as I took the last couple of steps. I could just barely make out the dirt-smeared floor in the paltry light from above. Looking up, I spied the string hanging from the bulb. I steadied the box against my hip and reached up. As I did, I heard something behind me creak. I whipped my head right, toward the sound, but saw nothing in the darkness. Probably my mom moving around upstairs or a pipe settling. Rolling my eyes at myself, I yanked on the string and dim yellow light from a naked bulb illuminated the room. The first thing I noticed was that the basement was much larger than the house that sat atop of it. I couldn’t tell exactly how much larger, given the pathetic amount of light provided by the single bulb, but I could *feel* that the room was more immense than I had expected. Odd, but I reminded myself that this part of Ohio was relatively rural and used to seeing long, hard winters. A large basement allowed for more storage of canned fruits, vegetables and other goods difficult to come by during the snowy months. Glancing around, I spotted some shelves against the left wall which seemed designed for just such a thing. I moved over to them and felt the hairs stand up on the back of my neck when I left the circle of light I had been standing under. I had read once that the vibrations of pipes can sometimes cause feelings of dread in people, often misinterpreted as something paranormal. I flicked my eyes up to the network of exposed pipes above my head and smirked. Of course. Quickly, I set the box down and got to work stacking empty mason jars in rows on the shelves. My mom was a prodigious gardener and would eventually fill up the canning jars with homegrown goodies, but that would have to wait until next year, as summer was coming to an end. Winter would set in quickly in this climate, and the ground would harden against new life until the late spring thaw. When the box was empty, I pulled my Swiss Army keychain from my back jeans pocket and broke it down with the knife. Curiosity got the best of me, and as I replaced the keychain, I pulled my cell phone out of my other back pocket and toggled its flashlight setting. Sweeping the bright light in front of me, I explored the parts of the basement not illuminated by the single bulb. A twisted heap of metal yard tools lay in the corner opposite the shelves, rusting from what I imagined was years of disuse. I couldn’t imagine Great Aunt Ira coming down here much in the past 15 years, not with her hip problems. Behind the stairs was the basement’s back wall, and I immediately noticed it was made of a different material than the rest of the basement walls. Moving closer, I brushed it with my hand. Some kind of corrugated metal, it felt like, which seemed out of place considering the rest of the walls were soft limestone, crumbling in some places. My hand trailed along the cool metal wall until I found myself standing at a doorway. The door was made of solid wood and sat almost exactly behind the staircase. It had been covered over, crudely, with wooden boards nailed across it. “Well, that’s weird,” I muttered aloud. It felt like the temperature over here was at least ten degrees colder, and my teeth chattered as goosepimples sprouted up all over my arms. I knew from many years spent in the Ohio educational system that homes all across the state had been used as shelter for runaway slaves during the Underground Railroad period in America’s spotted history. This area specifically prided itself in its abolitionist history -- perhaps I had stumbled upon an old, forgotten slave hideaway? Excitement coursed through me as I contemplated the fun of being the first to rediscover such an important historical site. Maybe there’d even be artifacts left behind. Growing up, I’d been fascinated with Indiana Jones and longed for the adventure of Hollywood-style archaeological discovery. Without thinking twice about it, I reached for one of the boards and gave it a tug. It was nailed pretty solidly, but I felt that it could easily give way if I put my back into it. I set my phone on the floor, screen-side down, so the light was shining up at the door, and gripped the board with both hands. I wasn’t a bodybuilder by any standards, but I did lift weights at the gym on a fairly regular basis, and my efforts were rewarded with a pop-pop as the board came free. One of the nails stuck in the metal, the other hung limply from the board, which I set down carefully behind me. It didn’t take too long to remove most of the boards. The door was most heavily boarded at the top, with a couple of longer boards covering the bottom. I was fortunate that the basement ceiling was low -- at 5’2” I had little hope of reaching something at the top of a standard-height door. But this door was only a few inches taller than me, and I was able to reach and pry loose the single board at its top with relative ease. The effort of removing the boards had me panting and sweating a little, the basement’s chill cooling the droplets as they slid down the back of my shirt. Finally, my task was complete and I was ready to crack open the object of my fixation for the past twenty minutes or so. I could hear my mom’s movements upstairs and figured since she hadn’t called for me yet, she would be okay on her own for a little while longer. The handle was long and rusted; I could feel some of the material flake off as I grasped it with a sweaty palm. I tugged gently, expecting to be met with resistance. Instead, the door popped open as easily as the sliding door of a 7-Eleven. I stumbled back a bit, kicking a board with my heel, causing it to skid across the floor with a hollow clatter. I was met with a blast of air that felt almost *arctic*, especially considering the basement was already fairly cool. It took a moment before my nostrils began to absorb the smell, but once it did… I nearly gagged. The frigid air emanating from the dark doorway was tinged with something rotten and earthy, like garbage that had been left out in the heat of the August sun for far too long. A horrifying thought occurred to me -- what if whoever hid down here never left? With trepidatious curiousity, I reached down and picked my phone up from the floor and pulled the door open all the way, shining its light directly into the blackness. It took a moment for my eyes to register what was right in front of them. I felt my heart slow, the blood in my veins turn to ice as a rush of naked fear cascaded over me. Eyes. Staring through the darkness, barely visible but for the weak light creeping past the doorway from the single bulb and what little illumination my phone provided. Each pair was looking straight at me. I took a shaking, instinctive step back out of the doorway. A hungry moan came from somewhere in the room. It was a gruesome, rasping sound that filled me with dread. “Hoooly fuck,” I whimpered, taking another step back. The sound of movement -- *scraping noises* -- shook me into action. My phone clattered to the floor, forgotten in my haste. I didn’t want to know what was in there. I didn’t want to see. I gripped the rough wood edge of the door with a damp hand and pulled it shut. It caught on one of the loose boards I had worked so stupidly hard to pull off just moments before. I registered movement in the darkness in front of me, the sense that something was close. Frantically, I kicked at the board, yanking the door hard as it slid out of the way. It slammed shut with a satisfyingly heavy sound, but as I leaned against it, my breaths erratic and my heart pounding, I felt a *thud* as something impacted with the door. That moan came again, desperate and needful. Another thud, this one hard enough to rattle the door in its hinges. Particles from the ceiling above rained down on my head. I wanted to cry. I needed to re-board the door. Bracing one hand against the door, just in case, I reached down and grabbed at the first board I could get my hands on. Some of the nails were still embedded, but others were scattered across the floor. A thud against the door shook the frame and my nerves. They wanted out. I did what any rationally minded, terrified person would: I screamed for my mommy. I heard her hurried footsteps approach overhead from across the house. “What’s wrong?” She called. “Did you hurt yourself? Did something bite you?” No, but something might be about to bite me. “No!” I shouted back. “It’s… I don’t… *mommy*,” I moaned the last bit as another thud shook the metal and wood I was pressed up against. I’m a heavier woman, but I wasn’t strong enough to hold a door shut forever, especially considering how many of those things there were. There were so many eyes. *So many eyes*. Eventually, my strength would give out. She thundered down the stairs, faster than a woman her age with bad knees should, but I guess that’s the power of motherhood. As she rounded the corner, it felt like more than one of them slammed into the door. I felt one of my flip-flop clad feet begin to slide and the door open just a crack behind me. I screamed and strained, regaining my footing and shoving my full weight against the door to close the gap. My mom was staring at me and the door with an almost knowing look. “What did you do?” “I fucked up, obviously,” I said through gritted teeth. Even under duress, she managed to get under my skin. “Do you have a hammer? We need to nail the boards back over the door.” “Yes, I’ll go get it,” she said, rushing up the stairs and away from me. I was alone again with *them and I didn’t like it. I began to sob, tears stinging my eyes. I didn’t wipe them away, not daring to move even an inch in case I lost my tenuous advantage. It felt like hours before she returned, but she did, moving slightly slower this time down the stairs while lugging a box behind her. It thump-thump-thumped down the stairs behind her, its contents rattling with each impact. “I brought my entire toolbox, just in case.” She pulled out an enormous, ancient hammer I recognized as the one responsible for almost destroying my thumb in second grade and a smaller one with a sleek black handle and a shiny gleam to its metal. Handing me the latter, she picked up the board I had kicked when I opened the door and moved toward me. “Keep your weight where it is, but duck down a bit. I’ll start at the top.” “Okay. Hurry.” She began hammering, and as the first nail was returned to its place, a piercing howl began from the other side of the door. I felt like I was going to throw up. “What the hell is in that room?” “I don’t know, honey. I don’t know. I told you something was wrong.” When the first board had been nailed across, we moved the heavy box of tools she’d dragged down with her against the base and I braced my foot against it so I could keep weight there while helping with the nailing process. Two boards, three boards, four. The howling continued, backed by that same hungry moan. The hair on the back of my neck seemed like it was never going to lie flat again. Some of the boards were rotted, and one split in our hands as we began to hammer. “Shit!” I yelled, kicking its remnants so several pieces scattered away from us. “Don’t think about it, just keep going,” my mom panted. Her salt-and-pepper hair was plastered to her forehead with sweat and she was breathing as hard as I was. We placed the last board across the bottom of the door, just an inch or two from the bottom. The howling had stopped, but the moaning never did. I’m not sure if it ever will. It didn’t look as solid as it did when I discovered it, but of course that makes sense. I disrupted something that had probably been there for years, maybe even decades. Who boarded the place up? What was in there? Did Great Aunt Ira know about this? What the fuck were we going to do about it? I voiced none of this to my mother, instead keeping silent as we piled anything and everything we could find in the basement against the door. I managed to remember to snatch up my phone before thundering up the stairs in front of my mom, anxious to get back somewhere that wasn’t cold and damp and full of *that fucking smell*. Once I had helped her up from the stairwell, I slammed the trap door shut and we moved her heavy antique dresser over top, then piled a few boxes of books yet to be shelved on top of that, for good measure. We collapsed on her bed and I cried while she held my shaking body, stroking my hair and whispering soothing words even though she was probably just as scared as I was. We stayed like that all night, and now it’s morning and I’m writing this to try and make sense of what the hell happened. I’m sitting in the living room, which from my estimate is right over where the door is, and I can hear faint moans rising up from underneath me. What did I awaken? I opened the door. I pried off the boards and I opened the door, and for that I am sorry. For my curiousity, for my stubborn refusal to consider the consequences of fucking with something that was clearly meant to not be fucked with, for my inability to leave the door alone and forget it ever existed. I am sorry. We’ve done what we can, but I can’t help but shake the feeling that it wasn’t enough. Not every door is meant to be opened. It’s only human arrogance that makes us assume we have a right to know, a right to see what’s on the other side. --- **Update:** Just wanted to let y'all know that my mom and I are doing okay. We had a long talk when she woke up yesterday and I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything she told me. I'll be writing an update for you guys asap. Thank you for all of your helpful suggestions and theories! I'm overwhelmed by the response this post has received. It makes me feel less alone out here. **Update 2:** [Read the second installment 
Learned this after noticing that the wrinkles in my freshly dried jeans seemed to be the same wrinkles they had before they went in the dryer. Started folding them before they went in the dryer; no more wrinkles. Works on other wrinkle prone clothes too.

I like jeans but it's frustrating to be going through a pair in &lt; 6 months because of my fat thighs rubbing together and wearing holes. The rest of the jeans are fine, I've contemplated trying to patch them but patches look terrible and I can never find iron-on patches that look like the jeans I have. I've decided to just give up on wearing jeans and wearing synthetic-type pants instead. The holes thing doesn't seem to happen with them. I have black trousers I bought from Lane Bryant that have synthetic fibers I have worn every day for 8 months + that have not had this problem. So, goodbye jeans. I don't know what the point of this entry is other than to vent. So.. :( 
Does anyone know how often American Eagles has a sale (storewide, not clearance)?? Stores like Express or Macys have a sale literally every weekend so I'm used to only buying things on sale. I found some comfortable jeans at AE from their Flex Denim series and was wondering if I should just buy it now or wait for a sale? 
So I was bored and decided to go through r/soccer and find the top 5 most upvoted goals from all of the World’s top leagues. Credit for the gifs goes to all the usual gifmakers – you all know who you are, saints of r/soccer. So here are r/soccer’s top 5 goals of the season. I’ve allowed any goals that were scored in any professional competition for that nation so there might be a few goals from the championship/FA Cup/Pokal/Copa Del Rey etc. Granted most of the goals are from that divisions top league, as that’s what r/soccer loves. Let me know if I’ve missed out any amazing goals that should be there. And jump straight to the bottom if you just want to see the collated top 10. **English football** 1) [Charlie Adam vs 2) [Patrick Bamford vs - Championship 3) [Graziano Pelle vs 4) [Coutinho vs 5) [Matt Phillips vs Crystal Just missing out were Juan Mata, Jermaine Defoe, and Jack Wilshere. **German football** 1) [Sebastian Kehl vs – DFB Pokal 2) [Pierre-Emmerick Aubameyang vs 3) [Robert Lewondowski vs 4) [Arjen Robben vs 5) [Cristoph Kramer own goal for Dortmund against Borussia I originally had this [Olic bicycle kick at number but pointed out it was from two years ago. And personally two of my favorites are [Bas Dost's sliced volley against and [this obscene team finished by Davie Selke for Werder Bremen against Leverkusen. Credit to for the suggestion. Also [Moritz Stoppelkamp's 83-metre strike against Credit to **Spanish football** 1) [Luis Suarez vs 2) [Fernando Torres vs – Copa del Rey 3) [James Rodriguez vs 4) [Lionel Messi vs 5) [Pablo Hernandez vs Atletico A bunch of Torres goals in the top 10 too.

If it isn’t Zlatan, r/soccer doesn’t give too much of a shit about the French. And I had to include the Ayew goal because there were only five Ligue 1 goals in r/soccer’s top 1000 posts from the last 12 months, so Ayew’s hilarious goal is in there. Credit to for giving me the name of the team for the Ayew goal. And for an all round better selection of goals see [this by **Italian football** 1) [German Denis vs 2) [Carlos Tevez vs 3) [Jeremy Menez vs 4) [Mohammed Salah vs 5) [Andrea Pirlo vs **Portuguese football** 1) [Eder vs 2) [Nani vs Gil - Gil Vicente sounds like a Star Trek character to me. 3) [Danilo vs 4) [Jonas vs 5) [Brahimi vs Also check out [this rocket from Eliseu against that was suggested by **Dutch football** 1) [Jeff Stans vs 2) [Uros Durdejic vs 3) [Anass Achahbar vs 4) [Joshua Brenet vs PEC 5) [Luuk De Jong for PSV vs Credit to for giving me the name of the goalscorer **Scottish football** - all credit to for the submissions.

And here are three other great goals I came across. Kind of surprised that there weren’t many Brazilian football highlights. **Brazilian football** [Elias vs Sao **Belgian football** [Tom de Sutter vs KV - Credit again to u/adriankg for giving me the name of the team **Turkish football** [Wesley Sneijder vs I feel like I’ve seen a bunch of great Sneijder goals on r/soccer this year, so I was surprised when this was the only one I saw in the top 1000. **Collated: r/soccer’s top 10 goals from across the world for the 2014/15 season.** 1) [Charlie Adam vs +5200 2) [Zlatan Ibrahimovic vs +5035 3) [Patrick Bamford vs +4845 4) [Lionel Messi vs Bayern +4835 5) [Graziano Pelle vs +4377 6) [Coutinho vs +4280 7) [Matt Phillips vs Crystal +4265 8) [Luis Suarez vs +4160 9) [German Denis vs +4150 10) [Fernando Torres vs +4140 Honorable mention to [this goal from Legia vs which is the third highest voted goal of the year but it’s a comedy goal. And [Wisla Krakow's Jean Barrientos brilliant just missed out on the top 10 by 15 upvotes Heavy Premier League bias in r/soccer’s top 10, but that is to be expected. All in all though, some absolutely cracking goals were scored this season. My personal three favourites being Ramsey vs Galatasaray, Pablo Hernandez’s back-heel, and [this amazing bicycle kick from Mauricio 
Figured I'd help spread the word, this is one of the best ways I can think of if. Helicopter overhead sayin' "Missing 3 year old child. Red shirt and blue jeans. It's currently 10:27. 
I am sooooo tired of buying black jeans that fade after only a few washes. what are some brands that you've had success with in the past that won't fade right away? 
My office dress standards are basically, a polo, at minimum, and jeans, at minimum (if not slacks). I have the slacks and dress shoes, and think they look good together. My semi-casual dress shoes are brown leather square toe slip on type. I feel like they look strange with jeans, however. Is there some standard for footwear that's somewhere between dress shoes and sneakers? In other words, if I'm not crazy (I feel like the answer is just wear dress shoes), what's the "normal" footwear to pair with jeans and a polo?

The real result will take many hours, and could stretch into tomorrow morning. **Links** - [Official - [2015 Greek referendum scenarios - [**/r/Europe Greek Bailout Referendum Live - Updated in real time. ---- Here's a TL;DR of the Greferendum: The question being asked is, essentially: ['should the proposal by the Eurogroup and International Monetary Fund be This quite opaque question is, in many ways, a referendum on Greece's current government, Syriza, elected in January of this year. **How did we get here?** Syriza was elected as the largest party in the Greek parliament on a radical left wing platform, and was able to secure a majority of seats in Parliament by forming a coalition with Greek nationalists. In their view, it is not possible, nor has it ever been possible for Greece to pay the huge amounts of money demanded of them. They also believe that the demands being made of them, especially the cutting of government pensions, are unjust. Unemployment in Greece throughout the crisis has remained well above 25% and youth unemployment is much higher. Therefore, they campaigned in January for a re-negotiation of Greece's debts, demanding 1) easing the tax burden of the Greek people 2) reversing spending cuts and most importantly 3) having a large portion of Greece's debt "forgiven". The European Commission [EC] (led by Commission President Jean-Claude Junker), the European Central Bank [ECB] (headed by ECB president Mario Draghi) and the International Monetary Fund [IMF] (headed by Christine Lagarde) (collectively known as the Troika) were obviously displeased with this result. From their perspective the new government had little authority to re-negotiate these already confirmed and signed agreements. Secondly, they believed that the Greek government had almost finished its reform process. By January 2015 Greece's was in primary surplus, i.e. the government was taking more in as taxes than it was spending. However, the money required to pay off the upcoming debt obligations, when combined with ordinary government spending, was still more than the government was taking in as taxes. Negotiations on the debt between the new Syriza government led by Alexis Tsipras took place, with Greek finance minister Varoufakis as chief negotiator. No deal which as acceptable to both sides was reached despite months of talks. Much to the shock of the entire world Alexis Tsipras called a surprise referendum with only a week's notice. After the referendum was called, but before it could take place (today), the deadline for Greece's debt payments came and the government effectively defaulted. **What will the consequences of a "yes" or "no" be?** A **yes vote** is the most straightforward. Essentially Syriza's position will be almost totally undermined and austerity will continue, much as it has done for the past five years. Greece will remain a European Union [EU] and Eurozone member, pensions and government services will be cut, and Tsipras and Varoufakis will likely from their current positions. However there is some degree of ambiguity. Given the fact that Greece has now defaulted, the offer from the Troika isn't necessarily on offer anymore. So they could refuse to accept it. Whether they do so or not is incredibly uncertain. A **no vote** is much more uncertain. The most dramatic speculation expects that Greece would run out of money completely and be forced to print its own currency in order to pay its bills. This would have two consequences: 1) free from the Euro, Greece would be able to devalue its currency over the longer term and make itself competitive against richer economies and 2) Greece would be in contravention of the EU treaties (which are effectively the constitution of the EU) and would therefore likely be expelled from the EU. However, even if Greece starts using a new currency, it may not necessarily be expelled from the EU. The European Court of Justice, and associated organisations, may choose to ignore this infringement on the treaties, or, or likely, the EU heads of government will gather and create a new treaty (effectively an amendment to the constitution of the EU) which grants the ability for Greece to remain an EU member despite infringing the treaties. But Greece may not even need to use its own currency. A further possibility is that Greece, in the event of a "no" vote, will start issuing "IOUs" (promises of payment in the future) alongside its use of the Euro. This is not a new currency and therefore in accordance with the treaties. The Greek government may hope that, at this point, the Troika will come back and offer new terms in their agreement. However, Politico's reporting of private conversations between Jean-Claude Junker and members of the Christian Democratic Bloc suggest that they are skeptical of Syriza's interest in obtaining a deal securing their place in the Eurozone at all. **So, what do the polls says?** [The polls are on a knife Some polling organisations have given the "no" camp a 0.5% lead, but there is normally a 3% error margin. Additionally, both a "yes" and a "no" vote are seen as radical choices, so we cannot rely on a last minute conservative swing as in other European referendums, like the 2014 Scottish referendum. **So there's really no predicting which way this is gonna go?** None whatsoever. **I guess we better sit back and bite our nails then!** Yes indeed. ---- **Further information** [Seven page PDF explanation by the University of [Greek Jargon buster / AKA "What the fuck do all these words and acronyms [Opinion piece by the BBC's former Europe chief editor (Gavin [Greek referendum: How would economists vote? - The --- **Live coverages** - - - - - - - [Le - [France - [The - - [Le Nouvel - [Le - [Le - - - [20 Your favourite news source is not listed here?

Hi all, I searched but surprisingly didn't find anything for brown watch bands. I normally wear either jeans or black pants, with a t-shirt or henley shirt. I'm 25M, and tend to dress more casual than anything. I'm just looking to find out if there are any fashion faux pas when it comes to watches with brown bands (is it like dont wear brown shoes with black pants?). I currently only wear this band which has a black strap and goes with anything (casual to suits). The specific watch I want to buy is here: **tl;dr mainly wear casual (jeans/black pants, t-shirts and henleys). Any reason I should be cautious getting the above watch/band?** 
My whole life I've had to buy jeans that are 33's or 34's and I have a 32 in waist. Even then, jeans are still much too tight around my waist. This is a problem because I try to dress professionally at work with a nice shirt and good jeans but 34's cinched down on a 32 inch waist doesn't look so great. i'd love some advice on classy jeans that can work in this situation. Whatever size jeans I buy I'm always looking for the most relaxed fit possible. Any advice here is much appreciated. Thanks 
I don't really understand the difference, could someone explain? I understand that tapered fits are loose on the thighs and skinny on the calves, how does slim tapered and regular tapered differ? Is it just a branding label (I've seen them on Levis, mostly eg. The 508s and 511s) Thank you in advance! 
I'm a second time dog owner, first time shiba owner. I've had my dog Lucy for 9 months now (got as a puppy). Shes a pretty independent dog and that's kind of what I wanted. She doesn't need to be held all the time need or us to be interacting with her which is nice IMO. And she's been pretty good until recently. She has recently started hoarding an object (usually a dog treat/bone) and if you go near her she'll definitely bite you, HARD. We hand feed her and constantly let her know that humans/hands are where food comes from but she just looses her mind every once in a while and just go nuts. Usually if I can remove the thing she's guarding from her she'll calm down in an hour or two. I watched some of ceasars vids on how to deal with aggresive dogs and have tried some of his techniques, but I just get bit a tonne. I wear jeans and usually some shin guards underneath and am careful to keep my hands and arms away. Last time I indirectly slowly inched towards her(calm and assertive) but she would just attack me. I tried out-waiting her, she would appear to calm down and lay down but the second I so much as shifted my weight from side to side she'd be biting my legs again. We don't give her any treats now only her normal dog food. We've found she's more likely to be aggressive if we take her for a longish walk on a hot day so we keep the walks on an energy expenditure basis and try not to totally exhaust her. Its hard to get help from dog trainers because we can't replicate the behaviour for them. The only thing she is afraid of is my hockey stick, but I've swear it's done nothing to warrant that control(no beating her or anything). Its only one particular stick which is strange because I have quite a few but the others don't bother her. The worst part of it is we get no warning. She'll be totally relaxed one minute and without a warning growl or bark; attacking the next. I'm at a loss as how to address this behaviour, and am tired of being bit. I have a new child and will absolutely not let them near each other. This dog is a danger to adults and would be lethal to a child. I'll never get another shiba and highly recommend others to avoid the breed as well. She's the best/most fun, great tempered dog 99% of the time but I can't deal with the unpredictability of her aggression. Edit: As a note we've had her checked by the vet and they can't identify any sickness or anything. 
If you dont act like a "stereotypical woman" then your one of those gays who "hates himself" "doesnt accept being gay" Is rebelling against being gay. When truth be told im being myself. I always get attacked by gay men who walk around in booty shorts hi heels and wear lipstick as being fake because I dont conduct myself the way they do and get called fake. The thing Is I have no problem with that i have no problem with a man walking down the street in booty shorts in hi heels wearing lipstick and asking to be refered to as shanaenae thats cool it really is. So why is it that even though im not in the least bit bothered or put off by that that gay men constantly tell me because I like going to the gym working out kick boxing and wearing jeans with a loose fit that im being fake. Why do they insist on telling me Im disgracing the gay community unless I act like a stereotypical woman? I get this all the time from stereotypical gay men "ESPECIALLY" when I decline any type of advances from them. its annoying I cant post this in reddit lgbt because even the mods say its self hate no the hell its not. I feel like as a gay man who does not act like a "stereotypical" girl my feelings are always shoved aside and dismissed as self hate. Its annoying and starting to create a resentment and disgust towards "stereotypical gay men. That may be wrong but I constantly end up butting heads with them over conflicts they start simply because I decline relationships with them. Can anybody shed some light on this I cant be the only one dealing with this. One of those types of gay men I encounter even threatened to out me if I would not sleep with him and I said um..... Im already out, also I dont get why if im so fake and self hating why these femenine gay men curse me out and call me fake for declining to go out wouldnt they want to go out with a more "real" womanly gay? Just using the logic these men approach me with. I have no problem with the way they conduct themselves so why is it they always have a problem with me AFTER they learn im gay but dont act like a woman? When they think im str8 its cool but when they learn im gay im called a self hating gay? 
I have worn all 4 pair of my jeans for over 7 years now. They are the most comfortable pair I've ever owned and they are sadly near their death. Knees are nothing but holes and holes are now starting to form under my butt. I hate shopping for clothes because they are always so expensive and really not worth it. My friend tried convincing me that $100 for ONE pair of jeans was a great deal (insurance came with the jeans but only covered dye damage). The jeans that I've worn for all these years are deb brand but they recently closed all stores and they stopped selling the specific line that I wore years ago. Where can I shop for good quality jeans that won't burn a hole in my wallet? I also am a fan of bellbottom or flare jeans if this helps, anywhere from a size 5 to a 9. Thanks in advance :) Edit: I'm a chunky woman, my thighs do touch. Also the jeans are beyond repair, they are barely holding together now. Edit: my hips are bigger than my waist. Waist 36" hips 40". I'm trying to buy online but the sizes never match up right...advice? 
I'm 6'3 and 250 pounds and I wear jeans with a 38" waist and 34" inseam. My jeans fit fine but no matter what I do, my ass crack shows. Im pretty illiterate when it comes to shit like this, are there any brands that make something for folks with my problem? I can tighten my belt until I pass out but I'll still have to pull my pants up around my ass. It's getting old.

So I decided to give a go, after all, hey it's $20, maybe it'll be a decent pair of jeans for an awesome price. An album will be available at the bottom of the post. Thanks for reading in advanced, and I hope this helps some of you on the fence about them. **Fit:** I am 6' tall and ~145-150lbs, and generally wear Levi's 514 (slim straight.) I ordered [These labeled as "slim," and even under the slim section of the site. The fit is quite a bit more on the "skinny jean" side of things for my taste, but hey, they'll suffice. **Quality:** Well, they're $20, you get what you pay for. They feel VERY thin, at least for jeans, and the fabric isn't you're standard denim. They feel kind of papery, if that makes sense (think of like a paper towel) and the pockets are VERY thin, and feel like they'll rip should I put a pen or keys in them. They also seem to stretch a bit when I bend my knees, but the site does say they are 3% spandex. **Experience:** Okay, so I ordered them last Thursday and they arrived today in a USPS flatrate box, so it was a pretty quick shipment, especially during the holidays. The Website was very easy to use and there was no hassle ordering like some of the higher end sites seem to experience from time to time (ex: "Okay, where do I put the coupon code? Why is there 5 screens just to buy something? etc.) Overall I'd say the jeans are worth the $20 I paid for them, granted I wasn't expecting much for $20 and I got what I paid for, and they're getting new items in all the time, so I may shop with them again. [Here is an album of the fit and Apologies for the shitty cellphone bathroom mirror pics. 
Hey, I'm a smaller than average frame/build. Basically it's hard to find jeans at 27-28 waist. Is it weird to wear women's jeans which run in smaller sizes? 
I have a pretty big ass and a lot of jeans look kinda off on me. Do I need to try a different fit or what. I'm sort of new to this whole male fashion advice thing. Thanks for the help. 
I need help in buying Citizens of Humanity skinny Jeans. I have been searching through large online stores amazon,shopbop and etc.,. Can anyone have any couponcodes regarding this please share. 
I've gathered a bit of denim jeans and shorts and when I gained my weight the last two years, I just kept my denim around hoping I'd fit into them again. Well today is that day, apparently. I took inventory of the jeans I couldn't fit into before and after I started my diet 9 weeks ago. This album outlines the results: This comes at a really great time considering I've hit a 2 week long plateau where the scale hasn't budged even down to the decimal point. Pretty excited that my wardrobe has expanded! 
I was browsing /r/Frugal and /u/AvsJen commented that Levi's has a lifetime warranty policy on their jeans. They will replace your damaged jeans, all you have to do is contact them then pay for shipping the pants to them. I did a quick web search and found forums where others confirmed the policy (found comments from as recently as 2012). The only reason that I've found they wouldn't honor the warranty was if the pants were 'too old', again according to comments on web forums. So if anyone wants to try this out and confirm, or if you've done it before and want to confirm, let us know. Here is the original comment by /u/AvsJen: Edit: The most relevant comment thread in this post confirming the warranty: 
I have an old pair or two of jeans, soft feel, that have become threadbare in the crotch. Beyond reasonable patching. Anything y'all do with extra fabric like this? Useful or decorative, give me your suggestions! 
I think this might be the first time ever skinny jeans have been worn by a man in a wwe ring. 
I bought a pair of Joes at Blue Jean Bar in early September. Was pretty pleased with them until Saturday, when they ripped on the left leg while bowling. Is this typical? I wear them once or twice a week max, haven't washed... seems like a short shelf life for a more expensive pair of jeans. 
I was wondering if they make skinny jeans that are FRC so I can wear them to work, I work at a chemical plant and my clothes need to be FR, for as I am tired of wearing a big Nomex. Thank you to anyone who can help me out. 
I've always worn a belt with my jeans since as long as I can remember. I usually buy my jeans a bit slimmer than my waist and my belt holds my jeans up. That being said, I put on some weight this winter (damn beer lol) and my waist has caught up to my jeans. Recently I have just opted not to wear a belt at all. I'm starting to like the idea of just having a comfortable pair of well-fitted jeans that doesn't require a belt. What about you guys? Thoughts? 
I just bought a new pair of 7 for all mankind standard classic straight leg indigo jeans. On my second wearing, I spilled ranch sauce on the thigh part. After wiping it off, it looks like the stain is not visible but I do not want it to show up some days or even hours later. Should I wash these jeans? If yes, how should it be done? Help is appreciated. Thanks. 
Im new here and although it is a small subreddit, i hope that someone may help me. I got a new pair of jeans recently, and i noticed they are barely long enough. With how i usually wash jeans, in cold water, they always shrink a little. and if this happens with my new jeans, they will undoubtedly become too small. If someone knows how to wash jeans so they stay the same it would be appreciated. 
Just like the title says. What are your favorite pairs of jeans? Mine are my black pair of slim fit se7en jeans, and coming in close second is a pair i just recently bought at RW&amp;co. They are a waxed denim and fit great!

Come up with a descriptive style phrase that's overly categorical and specific, like "defensive punk rocker at preparatory school," "grew up in the suburbs but then moved to the country and then to the city and then back to the suburbs chic," or even just "slowly melting special snowflake" and then compile a few inspo photos to try and visualize the style. You can also include a short description of what the person would actually wear. This will be a good time-wasting, procrastination exercise. 
I’ve been seeing some questions on the strange, confusing glory that is Rakuten. I’m no expert, just a lover of cheap beautiful garms and awful translationese, so other Rak users should feel free to chime in or correct anything I say here. ------- #####**What the heck is Rakuten?** Rakuten is like Japanese eBay, but you buy things outright instead of bidding. Like eBay, most things are used (though some sellers also sell brand-new stock). #####**What kind of stuff can I buy from Rak?** The best brands to buy from Rak are things that are cheaper in Japan than where you live. Usually, this means Japanese brands, but some non-Japanese designers are very popular in Japan for whatever reason and there will be a lot of their product for cheap. Other large designers that generally have a sizable presence should also pop up with some good deals, like Prada or Dries van Noten. Basically, just search around for your favorite designers and see what pops up. Often, Japanese products will be much cheaper even at MSRP than they are sold for in the US (for example, Kaico enamelware). #####**How should I search?** - *Search by brand.* This is the best way to search, in my opinion. Just inputting your favorite brand into the main search bar will ensure that you're getting (most) everything listed by them. I don't search by category exclusively; there's just too much out there (like eBay). - *Search within a shop.* The big shops have an overwhelming amount of stock, so sometimes I will just search for my favorite brands within a store I already trust. - *Use different/broader search terms.* Be prepared to spend some time browsing. Like eBay, you don’t want to limit yourself with overly specific search terms. In the case of Rak, this is especially important because usually the Japanese words are being translated from characters to the Latin alphabet, and misspellings can arise. So it’s better to search “Dries” over “Dries van Noten” in case a translation error prevents you from seeing things labeled “Dries van Notten.” Like eBay, don’t rely on the categories. Sometimes (not usually), items are misplaced within the left-hand categories, or the translation somehow didn’t make it into the English. For instance, I find way more dresses under “One-piece dress” than I do under “Dresses,” and I’m not sure why. I think it’s fine to go down two categories while still under a search term (for example, searching “Comme” and then clicking Women’s Clothing &gt; Bottoms). #####**How do I know if the seller is reputable?** You’ll notice quickly by using search terms that certain sellers pop up repeatedly. Generally, sellers with several thousand sales and at least a 4-star rating will also have the most thorough postings, with measurements and insanely detailed photos down to the last wrinkle. So, you usually won’t want to buy from less meticulous sellers with fewer ratings anyway. #####**How do I actually buy something?** If the store is listed on (which is the URL you should always navigate from), it ought to ship overseas. Basically, you order the item (and I highly recommend creating an account first to acquire points—see below), and 1-2 days later the shop will contact you via email in broken translationese asking you to confirm your order. The email should list the cost of the item plus shipping (which is usually $15 for something lightweight like a top or pants to the States). You need to then send a response email with some easily machine-translatable affirmation ("Yes, please send my order"), and then they will ship it. Most sellers use EMS, which is freakishly quick—it should get to you within a business week. Personally, I’ve never paid customs, but I’m not sure why or how that would vary in different countries. #####**Are there ever sales/bonuses?** Like eBay, sellers will sometimes put certain stock on promotion. It’s basically unpredictable (or maybe it makes sense in accordance with Japanese holidays?), so if you see something very cheap, don’t wait. Unlike eBay, Rak actually has a pretty good points reward system, so I highly encourage making an account. Basically, you get 1% back of the value of your order every time you buy something. There are also not infrequently store- or site-wide point promotions, where you can earn 5x, 10x, or 20x points from a purchase (so, 5%, 10%, or 20%). Your points accumulate, and you can use them all at once like cash once you have an amount you’re happy with (unlike eBay, which only distributes eBay Bucks quarterly). Do note that when you use your Rakuten points on an order, you don’t earn points *for* that order. So just use them on something cheap that you otherwise wouldn’t get many points for anyway. #####**Wow! Is Rakuten heaven on earth?** In my opinion, Rak is pretty great, but not for everything. What’s nice about Rak is that products are often in extremely good condition (even when they're listed as a "C" rating), and the major sellers (who comprise most of Rakuten) will have meticulous photos and measurements for their items. The point reward system is legitimately nice and not a gimmick like eBay Bucks. And certain brands are just cheaper used on Rak than anywhere else. What’s annoying is the learning curve as you wade through translationese and weirdly formatted pages. There’s also no hope (I’ve found) of contacting sellers for further measurements/pictures, so I’ve found it best to be cautious and not order something if I suspect it’s the wrong size (this is generally only a problem with smaller sellers who don’t provide measurements/good photos, though). I also imagine that returning something would be a headache. --------- Let me know if you have any more questions, or if there’s something else I should add to this guide!

**Random Fashion Thoughts** Post your random fashion thoughts here. 
Summer is slowly fading, so let's talk about what's inspiring you to put clothes on this coming fall/winter, what collections you're excited to see hit stores, what general silhouettes or uniforms you might be planning, and lastly, what you want to buy. 
I said I would post more reminders about it, but I have been sorely remiss. Sorry about that. 
My hope is that you can post something for which you would like to find some inspiration (ex. maxi dresses or pencil skirts) or just post some looks that inspire you. If you're looking for even more inspiration, particularly designer fashion, check out the Friday [WSheWT at /r/femalefashion!

As the Black Friday dealz begin rolling in, I figured it'd be good to have a master cop thread to keep track of the various promotions. Post any that come your way (coupon codes, sales, and/or individual items)! 
Still working out the kinks and schedules. Post thoughts, random or otherwise in this thread. 
So today I went to Building Block's store/studio. It's a bit north of downtown, and smack dab on the LA river. On the third floor of a brick building that I assume used to be some sort of warehouse (it's also near other warehouses/cheap artist space). is the imgur album, and I will describe my experience and the feel of the bags below. Damn, the store was really hard to get to. In order to get in the building I had to call up and then once I was in I slowly realized that the store was on the third floor after poking around the ground floor thinking I was missing something. However, I would say the third floor location was worth a bit of confusion. The place was light from the big windows all around the walls, and high enough that all that was visible from them was a blue LA midafternoon sky and the tops of some hills and buildings. The traffic noise was mild and a breeze puffed out the the sheets of opaque plastic that seperated the store from the studo. I didn't take any pictures of the studio space (the plastic and I also thought it would be super rude to take pictures of people while they were working) but I captured most aspects of the store side. Most of the objects there were not inventory, and what I was most surprised by walking in was how small the bags were. It was light feeling overall. I tried on/felt many of the bags there and my two main comments were that they were 1. Smaller and 2. Much more functional/comfortable than I had thought from the pictures on their website. The fold messenger in black, which is what I bought, is so goddamn pretty. When I tried it on it was clear that it was intended to be worn like as the strap is too short to be worn, especially by a long-torsoed person like me, in the typical messenger bag style. Sorry for the quality of the photos and my rambling- no one has done one of these on this sub before so I was not sure what to include. 
Google is telling me that today (May 4th) is Audrey Hepburn's birthday. Whenever the subject of style icons is presented over at /r/femalefashionadvice, there is almost always someone who picks her as theirs. For those of you who are a big fan of hers, what is it exactly about her style that makes her a style icon to you? If you are aspiring to dress like her, what are the challenges you've come across? Share your favorite fits as well! 
This weekend I decided to take an impromptu trip to the Rick Owens boutique, which is just north of Tribeca in NYC. The store itself is in a slightly out-of-the-way location, if you are walking there after spending the day in SoHo you'll have to trek past the Holland Tunnel entrance (where the cars are not jumping at the opportunity to let you pass, despite their red light) and around a very quiet block until you get to the corner of Hudson and Dominick Street. Due to the lack of color and glaringly obvious signage in the window, it is not the kind of store that immediately jumps out at you - I'd say if you weren't looking for it, you might not realize it's there. Inside the floors are concrete and the only color in the room comes from the clothes. There are two large, black, open shelving units with carefully-placed boots and accessories that also function as the store's "decoration." In front of one of them is a couch for all your non-fashion friends to sit on so they can have a rest while you freak out over something they just don't understand. There are 2 areas with rolling racks of clothes - in front is women's (mainline and Lilies are not separated) and in the back, behind the second shelf, is men's. There are two walls with full-length mirrors. This is definitely not a store focused on only showcasing clothes rather than having people try them on and buy them, which is sometimes the case with other high-end boutiques. There's a nice balance. When you walk into the store it is very quiet. I'm not sure if it's the fact that it's Rick Owens or just that the design of the boutique isn't exactly "inviting" that causes people to whisper around the clothes, but both times I've visited the store I did not hear any loud conversation. However, the sales associates are anything but cold and uninviting - although for some reason I feel like I have to ask them before I try anything on (I mean...it's just the polite thing to do when you're handling such expensive clothes, right?) I think they realized that I had no intention of buying anything, but the guy who helped me try on an amazingly cozy fur and suede jacket was super eager to answer my questions. He had all the information about their current line, previous lines, details on the jacket I was wearing, etc... These people know their shit and are the opposite of snooty. Anyways, I highly recommend that anyone remotely interested in fashion try to visit the store. I'm not sure what else to include in the write-up so feel free to ask for specifics that I neglected to address. And [here is a small

I thought it'd be nice to have a discussion on our aesthetic influences, why we wear what we wear, and how that fits into the greater context of our lives. **Promts** * Why do you put clothes on? What tiny detail fuels your investment into fashion past dressing just to leave the house? What about clothing grabs you? * What do you feel are your main aesthetic influences? Do you have any? How did you reach where you're at? * Do you feel like there is any validity in the term "dressed by the internet?" Do you think it's more or less valid than being "dressed by a magazine" or "dressed by your peers?" * How does context fit into your outfits? Do you dress differently than the people around you? Do you feel like your clothing is out of context? * I just read discussion over on /r/malefashion and thought it might be relevant to discuss here as well. Anyways, you can answer any or all questions, I just want to get some discussion going here that isn't based around buying stuff. Feel free add anything you think would be interesting. 
Post your recent cops on this thread, or ask for opinions on items you are wavering on. 
This subject is pretty interesting to me and considering the contentious Yeezy x Adidas collab, I think it's a relevant topic. So much of a label's hype is based off its publicity, faces, etc. but having a celebrity name attached can make true appreciation difficult. The title might be misleading, because celebs could be creative directors but not actually handle the details of clothing design. I'll provide some links to recent shows for reference: [Ulyana Distinctive vision or a one-note obsession with Russia? Either way, her collections are striking and a little playful, and I'm a fan of the Sergeenko woman.

So, I'm a girl, as I said, and I frequent this sub more than femalefashion advice, so I was wondering if I could get some opinions on this outfit (and clothes like this in general). I know losing weight would definitely help my overall appearance.

I am Love (*Io sono l’amore*) came out back in 2009 but I could not get it out of my head. It's a beautiful movie with a simple premise (nothing complicated here, but I will not spoil it for you). The storyline is a perfect setting for designer duds --- Emma Recchi (Tilda Swanton's character) is married to a very well to do textile magnate in Milan. You could see her transform from an uptight with not a single hair out of place woman to a more carefree (and happy) woman as the movie progresses. I know there's somewhat a backlash to the term "elegant" over at FFA, but she truly is an elegant woman throughout the film (as well as off). I rented the movie because Tilda Swinton was in the lead role and I have heard good things about the movie. Was pleasantly surprised to see Jil Sander (under Raf Simons at that time) and Fendi being credited for costume design. Then I got giddy when Waris (from [House of made an appearance in the movie (it's raining designers here, y'all). It's in Italian with English subtitles, but I sometimes catch myself paying more attention to the clothes than the subtitles (lol). Anyway, on to the clothes. I saw the movie some time ago so I can't get fresh screenshots, but here are some that I found online. The outfit that struck me most was the one with the orange pants. I could not find a good screenshot of it, unfortunately :( * Lilac coat with cropped white pants * [Purple dress - [full - so simple but the attention to details like the high v-neck zip and slanted seams make it not boring. * [Red - you know you're a statuesque woman when you can wear below the knee dresses/skirts and still look goddamn tall * [The one with the orange - it doesn't look much from here but it was striking in the film, I swear! * [I can't remember what scene this was * [Her daughter in law (the one in the middle) wearing a Jil Sander flower print * And the pièce de résistance: [this dress with a (faux?) wrap [back [with The screenshots really don't make the clothes any justice, you have to see it in action.

Let's talk about how fashion is being marketed and how you personally feel about them. Some things I have noticed: lower end brands tend to be more aggressive with their sales (looking at you Gap, BR &amp; Old Navy with your weekly 30/20/15% off sales). Others resort to shock value marketing (American Apparel, old CK ad --- remember that Brooke Shields ad?). Some higher end brands lend themselves an air of exclusivity --- "only cool people wear our stuff". Others rely on "opulence"/"bling" factor (instantly recognizable "expensive" brands like LV, Coach, MiuMiu etc). Which type of marketing/campaigns do you feel positively about? What makes you want to try a brand? Do you have a favorite ad? (Please share) Are there fashion marketing tactics that you find repulsive/insulting?

Free for all! | First off, we apologize for the sporadic posting of the weekly threads. We are happy to inform everyone that we are at the final stages of creating a new schedule and new threads which should be implemented starting next week. Stay tuned! 
Anything goes! Meet the community, introduce yourself :) We're not scary, we promise! 
Clear out your inspo folders and show us cool stuff. 
People look upon higher end fashion designers, specially ones known for their avant-garde flair, to push design boundaries when showing their collection on the runway. A collection not meeting these expectations are considered a failure by many *(surely I'm not the first person to go "...that's it? meh." to some collections)*. The pressure to innovate sometimes end up with gimmicky results. Would you rather see a gimmicky showing than a lackluster one? Where do you personally draw the line between gimmick and innovation? (Any examples?) ^(sorry if my questions sound disjointed, sleepy) 
What's on your shopping list and how will it propel your stylistic goals? What makes the things on your list interesting to you? How well do you think they'll interact with your other pieces? To expand further, do you guys make shopping lists/plan purchases or are you more on the buy cool shit front?

Pull out those folders crowded with gigs worth of pretty pictures and show me what's inspiring your fashion decisions. Pictures don't have to be strictly clothes either-- art, hamburgers and dogs are inspiring too. Drop a line or two in about why you like it.

Unlike recent purchases and cop threads, I thought it would be interesting to take a break from discussing recent and upcoming purchases, and take a look at things we're happy with. * This can be a thread where you post pictures (optional) and reviews of things you bought a while ago, why you like them, etc. (or even why you don't.) * Feel free to wax poetic on how content you feel about your personal style, wardrobe, shoes, whatever. * I want to encourage you to show off your tried and true pieces that have been with you for a while. * Elements of wabi sabi also an option... Have raw denim? Show those fades, worn in shoes and broken in bags. All too often in fashion we get caught up in constantly purchasing, reselling and searching for new items. It's good to look back on the things you've bought and examine why you like them and what made you get them.

I'm living in the US, we have a Jack Wills in Boston. I went there recently, just to look around, and it just happened to work out really well. The clothes just fit really nicely. Especially the dresses. I ended up spending $300 something. I didn't buy anything with just the name on it or a stitched logo, that's not my style anyway. But I've heard it compared to Abercrombie, and honestly I would shop at Abercrombie or another high school store if the clothes fit, but I probably wouldn't be super open about it. I'm a 23-year-old woman. So is it kind of immature and not my demographic? I'm not going to stop shopping there or return things, but I just want to know. Who do you associate with that brand? 
Post sales and discount codes here. If you have also browsed these sales and found some really good deals you'd like to share, then go ahead and post them here too :) 
Hey all, I have a beach wedding in July...also one in December...that I need dresses for - I've never been to this kind of wedding before so I'm not really sure what to wear and looking for some suggestions.

Let's talk about brands. Specifically, let's talk about how to mix and match brands, and what your philosophy is on pairing brands together. **Brand matchmaking**—what brands do you think go well together? What brand do you really like, and would love recommendations on complementary brands? Let /r/femalefashion do some brand matchmaking for you! **Brand synergy**—/u/pippafilippa has described it succinctly as "the idea that certain designers go better with each other because they have similar brand ethos". What's your opinion on it? Do believe strongly in wearing items _only_ from a particular brand? Do you think that brands are best paired (or should *only* be paired) when the designers' aesthetic perspectives are similar? Is brand synergy a valuable concept? BS? something in between?

Hey Reddit! I'm not sure if I should be posting here or /r/femalefashionadivce so if I'm in the wrong spot I apologize. Anyways, lately I've really been into oxfords and am trying to dress up my wardrobe while still keeping it casual and oxfords seem like a good choice. My friend has a pair of cheap ones from Forever 21 that I've worn a couple of times and I like the look except those ones are more of a flat, as they don't have much of a sole and are pretty flimsy, I'm looking for something a little more substantial without being too masculine. I guess I'm just curious what kinds of oxfords you are all wearing and if you have any recommendations. I like the brown and white ones but I think I'd prefer a solid brown/light brown more. I'll most likely be wearing them with dark wash straight leg jeans or maybe some chinos. I've browsed my usual go to shoe stores, Aldo, Steve Madden, and a couple others but nothing has jumped out at me. Thanks everyone! 
I found shoes yesterday and I think they are really nice. However, I don't know if the knitters in the back are too much and if it will be okay to wear them every day or only for special occasions? I work in an office but there isn't really a dresscode, more relaxed atmosphere. Any thoughts? 
Do a google image of "fashion (redditname)" and post fashiony results here. Let's do this! 
i'm not sure if this warrants it's own thread (if not, i can relocate this discussion to the next *random fashion thoughts*) but i was curious to know everyone's thoughts on wardrobe spreadsheets. there's been a lot of talk of them on /r/femalefashionadvice and /r/malefashionadvice, so i was wondering how those of us who are more in tune with their personal aesthetic and designer fashion approach the structure of spreadsheets. at first i felt they took the spontaneity out of fashion but now i obsessively curate &amp; refer to mine, especially as i've started to research/plan my purchases more. i have tabs for general (goals, measurements, colour palettes), wardrobe inventory, my french wardrobe, my shoe/bag/accessory capsules, my wishlist, and then inspriation (aesthetics, brands, stockists)--so verging on OTT. opinions? thoughts? feel free to share your own spreadsheets!

Hi beauties :) I'm here to talk about a more serious topic. Shopping addiction or compulsive shopping in general is sometimes played off as not a serious problem, and is something that is not talked about on Reddit much. But shopping addiction can cause financial ruin and severely affect personal relationships. That's why I started /r/shoppingaddiction, an online support group for people to share their stories and share their progress. I know there is already /r/MakeupRehab, but our subreddit aims to target shopping addiction in general, whether you like splurging on clothes, gifts, makeup, or vacations. I hope you will join us, whether you well on your way to solving this problem or just realizing the problem now. *Note: I did get permission from the mods before posting.* 
Hi! I just created a subreddit for those who are suffering from shopping addiction. Shopping addiction is a serious problem that can cause so much financial and emotional grief and it's something that is not talked about much on Reddit. You can take a look at Whether you blow your budget or are in serious debt, feel free to post about your personal story or share some resources that you feel have helped you. Thanks for looking and hope you have a wonderful day! 
Saw this great article today and thought it had a lot of great suggestions. I definitely need to start doing some of these things! 
This isn't the first time I've posted about spending too much on makeup, nail polish, and clothing, but I feel like I've "hit rock bottom." I moved to Seattle a few weeks ago with $700 to my name, and some of it was spent on stupid things like housing applications because I was too dumb to realize that in a major city, applying for cheaper apartments doesn't take weeks or months, it takes days, so applying online is useless. BUT they still take a $40 background check fee when you apply. But aside from that I've literally spent all but about $20 on makeup, nail polish, and clothing. I do have a job, and I actually don't only have $20 to my name, since I have a check for almost $200 that I need to deposit, but haven't figured out how to do that up here yet. I've realized that I don't think my makeup and fashion spending is just because I have an obsession with pretty new clothes and products. I think it's something I do to cover up some "deeper issues" but I really have no idea how to begin to address what all is involved there. I'm not asking anyone here to be a therapist or anything, but I'm looking for some suggestions for (low cost) options I could investigate or something. I don't even know how to look for therapy/counseling/psychiatric help because on the surface it just sounds SO FUCKING DUMB. Like "I buy so much makeup I need professional help" sounds like it should be some silly phrase on a poster by someone's makeup vanity. Not an actual description of someone's problems when they're talking to a doctor. 
Okay, I would not say I'm a "shopaholic", but I definitely realized I have spent way too much money on makeup I don't use. I'm definitely trying to change that. Since I've become aware of this, I've noticed a lot of posts on MUA that say things like: * Oh, I did a huge haul because I had a bad day today * Hey, at least retail therapy is cheaper than real therapy! * I haven't even gotten paid yet and I spent all my money. But that new X palette . . . ! * I always spend all my money at Sephora when I have a bad day! Oh well! Those are adaptations (so as to protect the innocent) of real posts I've seen from just scrolling through for like 5 minutes. What do you guys think about posts like that? They make me really uncomfortable. I want to reach out to the person and say there is help available if this is a serious issue they have. I really think a lot of people on MUA are trying to mask problems in their lives by buying a lot of new makeup. But then again, maybe not. Maybe those people who spent their entire paycheck on makeup are teens living at home who don't need to worry about money. Or even housewives whose husbands do not require them to put their extra earnings towards the household (that arrangement is common where I'm from.) Or . . . who knows. But somehow I feel that's not normally the case. Any thoughts? 
My boyfriend tasked me with getting some chargers from Amazon for us. This is a problem, usually, because its AMAZON! I have a bundle of wishlists on there (all of the high, none of the buy) and I, out of habit, browsed them to see if I wanted anything else out of impulse. I added something to the cart, but I stopped myself at the checkout and really thought about it. How dumb, I really didn't need that thing. I deleted it and only bought what I originally went for. Small step, but I'm kind of proud of myself! 
After I was rung up, I felt sick to stomach. I was immediately in a foul mood. I even got a headache. The total was $407.00 for 4 items. A winter coat, 2 pairs of boots for myself and 1 pair for my mom. I have so far in my shopping addiction. I no longer purchase designer or nondesigner handbags (trust me, I have enough to last me a WHILE). I no longer go on shopping sprees. I used to spend $400 on just one item and not blink an eye. Or, get a rush. But never have I felt so angry and disappointed at myself for spending $407 on 4 items. The winter coat I bought doesn't even FIT that perfectly. Both my mom and bestie told me it fit a bit snuggly...but I wanted it nonetheless because it's different and yet somehow fits all the parameters I require in a winter coat (ugh, I sound crazy). Of the 4 items, the one I don't regret buying is the pair of boots for my mom whose boots are about to break down (and having been taken to a shoe repairman twice already). She deserves them. I feel like I don't deserve this winter coat that cost $200 because I already have one. I don't even love the other pair of boots I bought for myself. It's been 6 days and I still feel angry, guilty and confused. Should I just return the coat and the one pair of boots I haven't worn yet? I think it would give me peace of mind. Am I crazy for freaking obsessing over this? :( 
Found this helpful, printable card that formalizes the decision to buy or not to buy (from [And Then We It should be helpful in forcing you to take a step back from the brink of a purchase and stop yourself from taking the plunge. Currently working on a reformatted version of the card, which I will link below later, as I know the linked version is a bit hard to read. [Should I Buy It? 
Hello all! To those of you who have found this place, welcome. I created this subreddit so that I could have somewhere to document my own journey on overcoming my shopping addiction and possibly spread the word to others who are struggling with their addiction as well. My addiction began in my sophomore year of college. I started out small, visiting Marshall's and TJ Maxx, trying on clothes for hours and only buying a few things that I liked. It was fun finally having financial and physical freedom from my very frugal mother. I remember my first big ticket purchase: a pair of red and white Ash sneaker wedges that I bought on eBay for $160. I still have and wear those shoes often and every time I love the way they make me feel and the endless compliments I get on them from strangers. Well, one pair of shoes wasn't enough, I remember a few months later buying a pair of Diesel high top sneakers in crazy colors. I bought them to use while breakdancing, my new-found love. I was buying them for a reasonable purpose, I justified to myself. And so the purchases continued. Sophomore year was the first time I had a part time job that paid quite well ($3000 of extra pocket change over the course of a year), and I spent every last penny. It was just so, so easy to buy things online and not think about the actual cost. I started spending more time online shopping, looking at pages and pages of products for hours on end. I got a kick out of finding things that were brand name on sale and using coupons. I could easily blow more than $100 in an hour online, splurging and then returning almost everything or selling on eBay when I regretted my purchase. Soon I was relying on my eBay income to paying my bill on time. I racked up a $1000 on Bill Me Later and was terrified of not being able to pay it when the end of the six months approached. But lucky me, I got an internship that paid $4000 for two months over the summer. I spent my first paycheck paying back the balance. And then the problem just got worse. I opened up a new credit card that had 0% interest for 15 months, because apparently I had racked up a great credit score after using Bill Me Later. I started buying things left and right. I started becoming embarrassed about all the purchases that were coming to the house and scared of my mother's angry outbursts over the money I was spending so I started hiding the problem. A couple of white lies when my mom would interrogate me about price or when I had gotten an item. I was building my new wardrobe trying to find my own sense of personal style, I rationalized to myself. It was only this summer, when my now $3000 balance was due on my credit card, $1500 racked up on Bill Me Later, and less than $1000 in my bank account (plus many angry outbursts from my mother) that I realized the full extent of my problem. I had spent over $8000 in the past year alone. And where had it all gone? I couldn't say. A $100 here, $200 there. It was hard to think that I had spent that much and so I had tried to block it out of my mind. It was painful, evaluating myself and realizing my shopping addiction was out of control. I am only been about a month into my recovery and I can say that I have faltered already with a few purchases. But I have blocked all my online sites and have all the money in my bank account queued to pay off my Bill Me Later account. I have my mother to thank for my credit card balance but it is painful having to accept help. I know I have a long journey ahead of me but I am determined to conquer this addiction. **TL;DR** It took three years and over $4000 of debt for me to realize my shopping addiction, and I am a month into recovery. 
I finally paid off the remaining balance on my Paypal Credit account today. It feels so good to finally be completely debt free! 
I came to this realization today. I was talking to an old friend that I hadn't talked to in a while. He said that I should hang out with some of my other old friends. At first, I felt resentful. They were an exclusive group, and I never felt good enough to hang out with them. When they'd make other plans by themselves and I wasn't invited, I felt shunned, back stabbed, hurt. I deactivated my Facebook just so I wouldn't see their posts about their magical outings that weekend. So instead I ignored them, poked fun at them. What they were doing was stupid anyway, why would I even want to hang out with them? So when my friend asked me to talk to them again, I thought why should I hang out with the people who excluded me? And then he said: because they feel the same way and they are lonely too. I shop because I want to be perceived as cooler, better, prettier than I am. I want people, so desperately, to like me that I empty my pockets at my whim. But all I really need to do is open up, and make friends. The only thing holding myself back is me. And it's time that I accepted that and moved forward. **Do you shop because you're lonely?** 
As we approach the holiday season, the number of "discounts" "sales" and "today only"s triple! What are you guys doing to avoid spending money on unnecessary items? 
I really, really want the new mega pro, and I have enough in my budget to cover it. But I certainly don't need it. I have talked myself out of it several times since I don't need any more neutral shades. But everyone else is getting a new treat, I want one too. Tell me this hype will pass and I will be okay without it, please. 
Shopping addiction or compulsive shopping in general is sometimes played off as not a serious problem but it can cause serious debt and severely affect personal relationships. That's why I started /r/shoppingaddiction, an online support group for people to share their stories and share their progress. Our subreddit focuses on shopping addiction in general, whether you like splurging on clothes, gifts, makeup, tech gadgets, or vacations. I hope you will join us, whether you well on your way to solving this problem or just realizing the problem now. *Note: I did get permission from the mods before posting.* 
I just was so tempted to buy a bunch of clothes online with a special email saying that everything on site was 50% off. I was so close to checking out but closed the window instead! I'm quite proud of this small victory. What small victories have you achieved recently? 
Well, I saved enough to move out of my friend's house and into a midrange apartment! Everything looked great and seemed ok... until I saw today that my mailbox was smashed in with a hammer. This is day 3 after signing my 6 month lease. The happy glow is gone and I'm starting to see the area I moved into for what it is... very dangerous. How was I blind? Well, simply put, this is how I always get when I'm excited. I don't see what I don't want to on high dollar things. Seems this apartment was no exception. So now, I have a new goal to work on, regarding this flaw in purchasing that I have. Trying to find some good in this situation, though. I realized while fretting about probably needing a PO box that I likely couldn't buy from amazon anymore. That was a feeling of dread and anger until it hit me... I can't order from amazon! This is great news! I'll live off the basics and cleanse my online shopping palate while trying to find a safer home. This is going to work out, I think :) 
What about shopping makes you love it? For me, it stems from childhood. Every year my parent took us school shopping. No big deal right? Well with 5 siblings that meant a rushed attempt at picking out shirts and jeans I liked, and usually ended with my sisters and I getting mixed up styles because my parents forgot who likes what. But then later in the year;my birthday, Christmas, valentines day, if I got good grades etc; my dad would take me on one on one trips. I would enjoy the time with him so so much! And he would take me to single brand stores instead of jcpenny or sears. It made me feel so special. Like wearing a brand gave me confidence. So i started to associate buying brand name things with feeling good about myself. As time went on, I started earning my own money and could buy my own makeup and clothes so my gifts got bigger. Because my dad had to work a lot, he tried to show us love with gifts. I got to drive my moms brand new SUV until I was given a brand new civic. I didnt like it, so I was given a new corolla. Then, senior year because I had gotten good grades, was in all AP classes, and got accepted to 4 really good universities...I got another new car. This made my siblings resent me as they were not given such lavish gifts. But it was a connection between my dad and I. And to this day I still associate love/self esteem with gifts. TL;DR: Gifts/Shopping =Love Tell me your stories. :) 
Im a bit ashamed but I feel posting here would feel like its less of a secret and something that can be owned, tamed and made better. Amazon has been a big culprit, and while I have gotten a little better, my self control slid back down to the dumps. Some things did feel necessary, like a Halloween costume, birthday gifts for my niece and bedroom things. That all wouldn't have even been too bad if I wasn't also so frivolous earlier in this month. Now, the guilt wash is hitting me. Walmart is also pretty bad because I circle the store and, if I need a brush, well "ill just look at the makeup. I wont buy." Then I do it :/ I justify it in the store, but at the register, I know the truth. I have all I need, I think. ***Plan Of Action:*** 1. I have to be more strict! Im removing my card info from paypal and amazon. 2. If I really need/want something, Ill sit on it for a week, maybe post here and see if Im being truly reasonable with my justification. 3. NO MORE WALMART! If I need food, Ill go to a slightly more spendy store, like Harvest Foods or Safeway. All food, no temptation. Even splurge foods will make me second guess because of the price. (I love "getting a deal," which is a good portion of my problem with Amazon) Here's to hopping back on the wagon and NOT giving up! I hope you're all staying strong. 
Here's a short checklist to check if you are a compulsive shopper, in case you were wondering if you really have a problem or not. If you answer yes to at least half of the questions, you might have a problem. This will be added to the wiki on the sidebar for future reference. 
Basically I am in grad school with no income, but I do have student loan money...which unfortunately I have no problem spending on clothes, makeup, shoes. My first steps to recovery are only buying gas, Rxs, and essential bills. Also trying to carry more cash! Just too easy to swipe the plastic and disconnect from the fact that I'm spending real money :) 
Interesting article. I especially like the line: "The more stressed I became about money, the more I shopped. It was a vicious cycle....." Thats pretty much how I am. 
Thought I'd share this segment of a National Geographic documentary on addiction. I thought it was really great that they included shopping addiction and featured a male, because shopping addiction can really affect anybody. It also opened my eyes to how much I buy and don't use through watching him spend. Starts around 3:30 and lasts until 15:30. 
Sephora sends out emails to VIB Rouge for early events and Special items. I received an email today for an Urban decay LTD palette, similar to the Vice 3. I resisted the urge to buy it as I have already purchased other items this week from FOREVER 21(I only bought necessities:under shirts for work, a pair of jeans and a sweater) and Sephora (gifts for the secret ghoul exchange and my best friends Bday). One small feat in my quest against shopping addiction! What have you done recently to resist an urge to buy something you didn't really need but wanted? 
The main relationship that was affected by my addiction is the one with my mother. As a frugal person, she didn't understand why I bought so many clothes and shoes. She was the type to only buy things that were dirt cheap and rarely splurged on herself except for vacations. My relationship with her was definitely affected by my addiction. She would yell at me and threaten to disown me, although now I know that she was just worried about me. I would hide my purchases from her or say that I paid less than I had to appease her coupon clipping ways. Since facing my problem, our relationship has definitely rebounded. Opening up to her about my debt was especially hard and was followed by a lot of heated discussions, but in the end she was supportive of helping me. I'd still be paying off my debt and racking up interest if it weren't for her. I'm so grateful that I have such love and support from her. **What is the effect of your shopping addiction on your personal relationships?** 
Hi All, Forgive me for the too long wall of text post but I've gotta get this off my chest. I gotta post here because there's no denying I have a shopping problem. Last year I quit drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes, two destructive habits that were totally ruining my life. So I joined AA and a few months later I quit smoking also. I quit smoking for financial reasons, but now I'm spending more than ever. I have always been a little iffy with my shopping. I have never been what I consider to be a healthy shopper. I spend a lot of money that I don’t have, I convince myself that I need this stuff and its not really negotiable, and that the items I buy will somehow make me successful so that I will have the money in the future to take care of my debt. I run an Etsy store that isn’t getting a lot of sales, but I’ve bought over $1000 in supplies for it. My shopping addiction has worked in many ways, when I first quit drinking I would hang out in Walgreens for 2 or 3 hours comparing prices and scoping out the sales flyer. I will shun an item that I know I can get somewhere else for even ten cents less, but then I will pick up something I wasn't even planning to buy and overspend on it. Penny wise, pound foolish. But there's more to this I think. I don't buy the item 10 cents "too expensive" because I will miss out on the high of "getting a deal" but I will overspend on an item to be "bad" or to "treat myself" because I "deserve it." I also have this illusion of scarcity that surrounds me. Like if I don’t get it now I won’t have the money or the guts to get it later. Last night and today I spent around $150 on shoes. I have not bought everyday shoes for over a year, a lot of the shoes I've gotten and have worn for the past 3 years have been hand-me downs or otherwise free. Last year I bought rain boots and hiking shoes, but no shoes for work or going out. My last two pairs of shoes are falling apart and are embarrassing to wear- I am often thinking of getting ready to go out or go to work and I dread putting on my shoes. So, I went shopping. I kept going on and on in my head about how I should have a type of shoe for every occasion. So I bought 7 pairs of shoes. I am happy about a few of them, I got a pair of timberland work boots (I'm an artist and do a lot of work stuff) but I also bought 3 pairs of sneakers and 3 pairs of boots! It was overkill. What was I thinking, after this I will never have to buy shoes again? I lumped it together with some other stuff I've been planning on getting for a while, 2 screenprinting screens and some rechargeable batteries, and a birthday present for my boyfriend. The grand total? $247.37. That doesn't really seem like a lot of money for 7 pairs of shoes and all that other stuff I mentioned. But that's on top of the $1500 credit card balance I've run up so far this year. And it's not like I only spent $1500, I am running a $1500 balance after I have desperately been trying to pay it down. And, so my stress is mounting and with this shopping thing and I don't really know how to control it. I managed to spend $250 after promising myself I was going to budget for what I plan to buy. I bought YNAB at the beginning of the year and I have been entering my transactions dutifully, until I inevitably spend so far outside of my budget that I get confused and have to "start fresh" with YNAB. I promise myself all the time that I am not going to spend outside of my budget and I'm gonna yadda yadda. I have overspent IMMENSELY in 3 categories this month. Food, personal care, and clothing are all blown to bits. I don’t do as much impulse buy stuff so I don’t have like piles of knickknacks accumulating quickly, its mostly art supplies and like stuff for my craft booth. But this 7 pairs of shoes I bought last night I dunno- I dunno where the money is going to come from to pay it all back. I mean I do, but I know I will spend more so I feel like I may never get out from underneath it. $1700 in debt isn’t the end of the world, but not knowing when I am going to truly stop myself is terrifying. I also have $11000 in student loans, so I am making payments on that. Has anyone gotten ahold of and truly curbed their shopping addiction? I also have a problem with taking home free stuff from work (broken stuff) and stuff that comes from the side of the road. My life is looking a little cluttered at the moment, and I wanna stop that too! thank you for reading my post! 
Like a smoker who eats candy instead, what do you do instead of shopping? 
When you're addicted, a want is a need. You just need that shirt/dress/watch/lipstick. You go to every store just to find that limited edition item. The want consumes you until you can't resist and you pull the trigger to buy that lovely, perfect item that will be perfect in your home. And once you get it the guilt sets in. Why did I spend so much money on that?? This is the last thing I'll buy this week/month/year. The important thing is to retrain your brain to know the difference between wants and needs. Needs are things you can't live without - air, water, food, shelter. Wants are that new bag, that car, that expensive dinner. Then there's the gray area. Oh, I NEED this jacket because it's so cold and the one I have isn't good enough. I NEED this foundation because the one I have that I've barely used just doesn't match my skin tone. The life of an addict is always unsatisfactory. Start appreciating what you have. Realize that many items you already have can be used for the same purpose. You don't really NEED anything until the old stuff you have breaks or wears out. When you stop buying out of want and only what you need, you'll finally be free. 
Many people laugh at the idea of shopping being a disease. I think it is safe to say, a lot of women love shopping. Reasons varying from a love of new items, a sense of competition to have the next best thing, emotional coping, a sense of entitlement and many more reasons. So when is this hobby a problem? [Web has it listed as a disease under Addiction. No laughing matter! 
Since there have been a couple of posts recently relating to this, I found a couple of tips in [this about how to prevent shopping binges. &gt;* Pay for purchases by cash, check, debit card. &gt;* Make a shopping list and only buy what is on the list. &gt;* Destroy all credit cards except one to be used for emergency only. &gt;* Avoid discount warehouses. Allocate only a certain amount of cash to be spent if you do visit one. &gt;* "Window shop" only after stores have closed. If you do "look" during the day, leave your wallet at home. &gt;* Avoid phoning in catalog orders and don't watch TV shopping channels. &gt;* If you're traveling to visit friends or reltives, have your gifts wrapped and call the project finished; people tend to make more extraneous purchases when they shop outside their own communities. &gt;* Take a walk or exercise when the urge to shop comes on. &gt;* If you feel out of control, you probably are. Seek counseling or a support group such as Debtors Anonymous. 
This is some advice I learned from browsing FFA recently (see [post in particular /u/thethirdsilence's comment: &gt;One additional piece of advice: do not do an overhaul in anticipation of a lifestyle change. People often do this when they are about to move abroad, go to college, or start a new job, and it's better to wait till you've settled into the new... &gt; Some reinvention can be fun, but reinvent after the change, not in anticipation. I was about to buy a ton of stuff today in anticipation for my new job that I'm starting Monday (in particular a work bag and work clothes) and this advice really saved me. I remember shopping in anticipation for a lot of things, like travel, going to college, etc. and I didn't really need all of those things! I already have a couple of work outfits that I can recycle for a bit before I need any more. So, I'm going to wait a couple of weeks until I start and then see what I need by seeing what other people in the office have. Thought I'd share this advice with you guys and hope it does you some good as well :) 
Clothes are my shopping vice so I decided to create a list of questions to ask yourself before making a purchase. I think it will help you buy the things you really want and be more satisfied with purchases you do make, which will in turn stop you from shopping more! Some of them may seem like common sense but it is good to double check before you get caught up at checkout. 1. **How many times will I really wear this?** If the answer is less than 5, reconsider. 2. **What occasion will I wear this for?** This one goes hand in hand with number 1. While there are a few exceptions (such as a wedding!), if you don't foresee yourself going to any of these occasional events in the future, don't buy it. For example, I was so tempted to buy a long white skirt for my wedding for the longest time and I'm not even engaged yet! 3. **Can I wear this now?** I sometimes buy out of season clothes for the low prices but usually forget that I've purchased them when the next season comes around. Do yourself a favor and don't hoard, buy when you really need something. 4. **Do I already have something that is similar to this or serves the same purpose? If so, do I really need another?** I am a multiple offender to this one - even if I have something in my closet, I continue to look for alternatives to things I already have but really love, like black boots or a-line dresses. 5. **Will I be comfortable wearing this in public?** If your style is more modest, don't look at the crop tops or backless shirts that are in trend right now. Seems like a no brainer but I've *bought* a couple of things that I never wear because they're too revealing. 6. **Will the item I'm considering be in style in 5 years from now?** Trends come and go, but I believe style should be timeless. If something will look gauche in a couple of years, it better be cheap. What are some questions you ask yourself before you make a purchase? Are there any items you've bought that break any of these questions? 
I have been putting off writing this because I know once I post it I am going to have to change. Then I realized I was browsing eBay again to procrastinate, so I better get this done. My name is tundratess and I am shopaholic. There, I said it and there is no going back. I am going to help u/lifesurfeit moderate this lovely new subreddit and help keep myself accountable at the same time. One of the great things about a brand new sub is that they generally have fewer members and that really gives people the opportunity to get to know each other. So let's build a community! My name is Tessa, I live in Alaska and I am 40 years old. I've been happily married for 17 years and together we have 3 kids. Our two oldest have already left the house leaving only our 15 year old son, who is high functioning autistic, still at home. My shopping issues started about 13 years ago when we moved into the house we are in now. My husband set me on the task of decorating our home and I discovered eBay. Then I lost 80 pounds and bought myself a new wardrobe. Then I took up makeup as a hobby and invested a fortune into my collection. I am a bargain hunter, so I convinced myself my spending wasn't really an issue. I mean really...It's only $10 what's the harm? Of course that was $10 several times a day every day. When I'm not spending money I am browsing online and planning my next purchases. I have racked up a huge credit card bill over the last few years and it has to stop. So here I am, helping myself and hopefully helping some of you along the way. Please, introduce yourself! 
I noticed a couple of weeks into my no-buy that I was feeling super bored all the time with all the free time I had. It was a feeling of extreme emptiness. I also had drastic mood swings from feeling great about myself to thinking I was absolutely horrible. Fortunately, these symptoms have generally stopped about a month later. Has anyone else felt any sort of withdrawal symptoms from not shopping? 
Yes,today I met my mailman for the first time. I walked into the mailroom as he was finishing with the last of his mailboxes. This is what he says "ooooohhhhh, so *you're* the girl with *ALL* the packages every week! Nice to meet you" I couldnt help but to feel embarrassed. Out of all the apartments he services, and who knows how many homes, **I** am the "girl with the packages". I saw no use trying to make an excuse, so I told him I love online shopping and I was almost singlehandedly keeping the usps in business which made him laugh..after a few moments of chit chatting away I went to my apartment. I still flush thinking about it. I mean, my apartment complex is huge. And there are always so many packages in the office for tenants. My shopping habit is not only noticeable to those close to me, but to people who know me by association! Have you ever been embarrassed by your shopping addiction? 
Hello everyone, As this subreddit continues to grow (almost 50 members at the time of this post!), I definitely would like some help moderating this subreddit. This is the first time I have moderated and between school and applying for jobs, I don't always have time to check up and give you guys the love and attention you deserve. The only requirement would be a history of being active on Reddit in general, and previous experience moderating is a big plus. Please pm me if you would like to help out! 
As I am just paying off the last of my credit cards, I'm looking for advice on how to budget. I do have a Mint account but have blown my budget for clothes in the past so I'm afraid of doing this in the future. **What tips do you have for effective budgeting?** 
Another of our weekly discussion threads.

So it's happened. I've gone a whole month without purchasing anything non-essential to living. It wasn't easy. I was tempted many times with email offers, in-store displays, and eBay. Especially in the beginning, stopping myself from purchasing was hard. It took all my strength to close a tab of Chrome and stop looking at a shopping site. Now, it's almost become second nature. I just think: 1) do I really need this? 2) will I be regret buying this in a week? 3) does this fit with my personal aesthetic/lifestyle? The biggest change that I've seen is that I have so much more free time. I didn't realize how much time I was spending browsing online shopping sites until I stopped. In the meantime, I'm applying to jobs (about to graduate college), experimented with makeup/accessories/clothes that I already have, watched tons of Netflix, and have thought a lot about why I needed to shop in the first place. I think the truth is that I bought clothes to look better and feel better about myself. Only buying things didn't help my confidence. I'm starting to try and accept myself as who I am on the inside and work on my feelings some more. I've taken time to try to reconnect with old friends that I lost touch with too. But I definitely couldn't have done this without you guys. I learned a lot through talking with all of you and reading your suggestions. I hope that we can continue to grow together and support each other as a community. I'm still tempted, especially by the huge Solestruck sale on Monday (noo), but I'm determined to finish off one whole year without buying anything else. 11 more months to go! 
I didn't realize how much time I spent shopping. Now I am finding all this time on my hands and I don't know what to do with it. Do the rest of you have the same problem? What have you found that helps? 
I just found out this method of adding a password to my Block Site extension and thought it would be helpful to fellow online shopaholics. 1. Install Block Site [[Chrome [[Firefox You may have to restart your browser to finish the install. 2. Navigate to the Extensions list after it's installed. 3. On Chrome: click the three line icon in the top right hand corner, and click 'More Tools', then 'Extensions'. On Firefox: click the three line icon in the top right hand corner and click 'Add-Ons'. 4. Find Block Site in the list and click 'Options'. Add a list of your most beloved websites to block. Make sure you get all of them! I would check your spam folder in email to make sure you get all the shopping sites you're subscribed to. 5. Now it's time to lock it by adding password protection. For Chrome: I believe you navigate to the 'Uninstall Protection' on the left hand menu and select 'Enable Authentication' (can't remember because I already locked it and can't see the options anymore - correct me if I'm wrong!). For Firefox: tick the box that's marked 'Enable Authentication'. 4. Enter a password into the text box - I button mashed the keyboard so there's no way of removing it! Or you can have a friend type in a password that only they know. 5. There you go! A virtually unremovable extension that you can't cheat with. Enjoy :) 
Temptation to shop often tests our determination to stick to our goals. Share any recent temptations that you've beaten (and tips how!), temptations that you're having difficulty with, and/or temptations that you submitted to. 
And how are you coping or are you planning on eating enough turkey that you'll sleep through it completely? 
Since allowances as a little girl I've been spending money to the point of broke. I've haf a lot of hurt in my life and the amount of money I have is the amount I can spend to fill a void. My nana passed Monday and I'm back home with $54 to my name. I squandered $2500. I've got debts i want to pay, I want to go back to school, I want to change my name, get health insurance, and I've done none of that. Something has to change, and since im 25 now, Im aiming for 5 years to get my finances correct and A+. This is the beginning. 
I have a family member who I believe has a shopping addiction and over buys many items that are not necessary. I am just trying to understand what some of the causes are. 
I don't know if you all have heard about this movement but it's all about making a promise to yourself and keeping that promise. You can request free cards from them or print them for yourself. I personally have a card in my wallet to remind myself not to do anymore shopping! Hope these help you with your New Year's resolutions :) 
Hello new subbies! Please take the chance to introduce yourself if you haven't done so already. You can either comment here or do a self post. I'm eager to meet all of you :) 
Some triggers for me include: - watching hauls on Youtube - seeing posts about purchases on Reddit - browsing online shopping sites - going to clothing stores with huge discount racks (like Macy's) What I did to combat: - unsub from Youtube people/subreddits - website blocker for shopping sites - avoiding shopping in retail for now **What are your triggers and how you avoid them?** 
Disclaimer: I'm new to Reddit, so I apologise if I break any rules. Also, I feel like this post is going to be ginormous/verging on TL;DR territory, so delve into it at your own risk. Over the years I've been addicted to buying all sorts of things, I've gone from books, to DVDs, to yarn (knitting/crochet), to nail polish, to shoes and currently, clothes, make up and skincare products. I really like being on the computer and comparing products and prices. I love watching YouTube videos, make up tutorials, product reviews. I'm really bad/irresponsible with money and I tend to live paycheck to paycheck. I also have a sizeable credit card/loan to pay off. I keep telling myself that I have to sort this out but the problem seems so insurmountable that I never start. I'm absolutely an emotional spender, if I've had a crap day and am feeling down I will go on the computer and eventually buy something (because obviously I NEED IT and it will fix everything that's wrong in my life). I've finally reached the point where I am sick of counting down the days until I get paid (which is monthly - it's a pain that never ends). So, at the ripe old age of 27, I'm taking the plunge into being an actual grown up. My first step was to download a budgeting program called YNAB - You Need A Budget, (not just a clever name). Which seems really cool and I feel like I actually have a hope in hell of sticking to it (unlike the other bajillion budgeting/finance apps I've tried. Away I go! 
Im using this sub as one of many avenues for helping myself with my many issues one of which being a former shopaholic (while I still shop more than I should I am much better with it than I used to be). So one of the things I want to do is "own up" to my bad decision-making/habits and just put it out there because I think putting my secrets out in the light will help me to deal with why I have them in teh first place. I will use this sub to make sporadic threads about what ive bought. This first one here is about nail polish. As the title states I own 165 bottles (I counted). Ive collected them for over a decade (side note, nail polish holds up really well if you keep it closed tight and away from sunlight) and the very vast majority Ive paid $0.99 for (the highest I paid was $7.99 for one sally hansen color, while some were $0.49 on clearance or $2.99 or so). I don't have any designer brands they are all drugstore brands. While the majority are Sally Hansen (I recently found a store that sells discontinues colors for $0.99 which retails for $8.99 new in drugstores, so that's been an obsession now to get as many colors from that line as I can), I have everything from O.P.I to Wet-n-Wild. And the majority Ive never even used I just bought because I liked the color, it was on sale, or it was part of discontinued line Im obsessing over. Because they are so cheap its like a "treat" for me to buy 1-3 bottles a week. I go from not buying any for years to having periods of buying all the time (that happens with all my shopaholic issues where I obsess over a particular thing) and I dont even do my nails for long stretches of time (currently havent done my nails for about 9 months). This first thread is about nail polish because Im also trying to declutter/get my financial life in order and that involves getting rid of things I dont use and that I can possibly sell on ebay for money. So I went through all 165 swatches and im giving away 36 (if I cant sell them for cheap on ebay I will give to salvation army). 
I really agree with the statement "...it's important to understand what doesn't work. A shopping addiction is not a disease of intellect; it's a disease of emotion." While I think this has a lot of good info and advice, I cant help but to disagree with step 3. Replacing the habit with something else. Yes a healthier habit is what we are told. But is that nit swapping one vice for another? ["5 ways to beat your shopping What do you guys think? Do you find this article helpful? 
Coming into Holiday season, all the brands are releasing their limited edition sets and items. A lot of UK and Aus girls want them, but the price to them is crazy. So, as a middleman of sorts, I have been buying the items and shipping to these girls when requested. And doing this about 3x a week has taken over for my need for personal shopping. I get the feeling of excitement to open the boxes when they arrive and i dont feel remorse when I repackage them to send out to the actual buyer. This may very well be helping me kick my addiction! 
I'm excited to announce our first monthly challenge! This is designed to kickstart your efforts to stop spending and collectively challenge ourselves together. **What**: A challenge that will be held for a month with /r/shoppingaddiction members who wish to participate. The challenge involves several parts: 1. Create a list of Needs which include rent, utilities, bills, food, etc. Whatever you *absolutely* need to live! 2. From your Needs list, figure out which can be reduced. For example, can you cut your food cost by perhaps eating out less. 3. Make a list of wants. This includes things that aren't necessary, like buying makeup, Starbucks, shoes, whatever's your poison. 4. This is the hard part. STOP SPENDING money on Wants! 5. If you're doing the spending diet, you can allot yourself a monthly allowance for your Wants, but keep a record of your allowance spending. Once you hit your allowance, you should be on a Spending Fast - that means no more extra allowance/spending on Wants. **When**: Starts 12/1/14 and ends 1/1/14, but by all means continue if you wish! **How** (to participate): Comment on this thread with a list of your needs and wants if you wish to participate. We'll have a discussion thread every week about our progress for the challenge. Based on AndThenWeSaved's [Spending and [Spending 
i have tried everything (counseling, family interventions, psychiatrist for her, psychologist for her, working on a budget together, reasoning with her, show her what she is giving up with her waste, countless other things). it is all to no avail. she still thinks that she has no problem. she feels that it is perfectly reasonable for her to spend 6 figures in year and destroy our future. she thinks it is perfectly reasonable to fill every room in the house with useless junk to the point where i have difficulty moving from room to room. so this week, i will be giving her an ultimatum. either she gives me 100% complete dictator control of ALL family finances and ALL spending...or i divorce her and take our 2 kids with me. i fully expect for her to blame me and choose her spending over her family. is there any advice you can give me for how to lay out my ultimatum? the ideal solution is for her to seek the help and treatment for her disorder. but i have almost given up all hope of that happening. 
...that I was shopping again. It was a little scary but she was amazingly supportive and just encouraged me to save money for bigger things, like buying a condo with my boyfriend. I cried a little but it feels good to finally admit that I have a real problem. I'm trying to go on very slim budget in the coming months now that I'm renting my own place. This time I think I can do it. 
Hello! I created a subreddit/support group for those who are suffering from shopping addiction. I know shopping addiction is a serious problem that can lead to hoarding, and thought it might be of some interest to y'all. You can take a look at /r/shoppingaddiction. Thank you and have a wonderful day! Note: I received permission from the mods to post this. 
Monday: Progress Update How are you doing? Have you been meeting your goals recently? Share your progress, confessions and advice here! 
I found these two articles as interesting sources. The first gives a few tips on how to stay busy; the second, while aimed toward drug addicts, emphasizes the importance of staying busy in early recovery. Just some things to keep in mind in your journey. I wish I had known about these earlier - could have prevented a couple of slip ups! 
How are you doing? Have you been meeting your goals recently? Share your progress and advice here! 
Instead I've decided to knit something special for my mother and sister. It's also taking my mind off all the holiday ads by not looking at them and obsessing over all the things I want - because I now realize that greedy monster will drive me to ruin! Buying things for other people is still shopping and I can't break my goal. How are you guys dealing with the holiday rush? Any plans or goals to prevent a shopping binge? 
Share some things that you've found in your stash recently that you've been face-palming over, found and loved, and/or things that you're getting rid of and future plans to prevent unnecessary shopping. 
It's been years in the works, but I finally resolved to take action over my shopping problem this weekend. I am at work typing this, as this time will be spent on ebay if not this. Which is shameful. I could tell you my whole story but I won't. I just want to say that I'm relieved that while searching for some definitions on the internet I thought to do a reddit search resulting in finding y'all. I guess the main purpose for my post is: is there anyone here still? Last post was made a week ago... 
I have a one year old son and I am completely addicted to buying clothes, toys, and books. I spend HOURS every night researching the best toys and books to buy and browsing clothes online. I finally realized how ridiculous this is when my husband and I talked about buying a new house and my biggest reason for wanting a bigger house is because we don't have enough room for all of our son's toys. We have the money, and my husband never says anything, besides sarcastic remarks about how much crap the baby has, but I know he hates it. And I still feel guilty for wasting so much money. This kid is perfectly happy playing with measuring cups and spoons. What is wrong with me?! 
Hello everyone! Thank you so much for posting and helping our little community grow. I would love if we could post more, so I'm asking for your feedback and suggestions on the changes to the sub so far. * Do you guys enjoy the user flair? Should I add more options, or limit to just the four: No-buy, Low-buy, Budget, and Ex-Shopaholic? * Do you guys like the new link flair for posts? I know not everyone knows how to use them so would it be helpful to add a tutorial about that? Or would you guys prefer not to have it at all? * Should we have more structured weekly posts like some other subs? Just a couple of ideas I had were: share your progress Mondays, talk about your temptations Thursdays, and feedback Friday. And of course any suggestions you may have to improving the sub are encouraged. I hope we can continue to improve this subreddit into a thriving and supportive community! 
So, I just found out this was a thing. There is a ["My Shopping show that started airing on Oxygen on October 15th. Have any of you seen any of the episodes? What do you think about this show? Does it portray shopping addiction as a problem or a spectacle? 
It seems a lot of people have been anxiously awaiting the Sephora sale in November. Are you planning on jumping in or sitting it out? 
Share your goals for conquering shopping addiction here! 
This was just posted in /r/stopdrinking, but I thought it might be valuable for us shopaholics as well. How to cope with your addictive urges with the help of the SMART guide. I edited the post just a little to be more suited for shopping. How to cope * Avoid- identify high risk triggers and stay away from them * Escape- you're in a high trigger situation. Get the fuck out. * Distract- literally start saying the fucking alphabet backwards. Multiply. Drop and do push-ups. * Identify Coping statements- "I deserve this thing because "x"" becomes "x sucks, but throwing money out is not going to solve it. * Review cost benefits - what are you long term goals? Benefit of buying? Benefit if not buying? * Urge log! - log urge, acknowledge it, learn from it * Moments of clarity- remember when you are thinking like an adult. Remember what that adult would say. Ignore the child. * Remember the shit - remember how awful you feel after spending money you don't have for stuff you don't need. * Picture the brighter future- Start a new month without expensive bills * Undress it - acknowledge the urge. Not it. Stare it down. See it naked. And let it go Hope this helps! Better not to window shop and that way avoid the urges alltogether 
I know I have really been off the rails recently so to combat my insatiable appetite for fashion, I am planning to do a couple of things, combining tips from other readers. - **Post images of things I want to my personal tumblr.** this way I can window shop and save items that I might be interested in later without the buyer's remorse. I'm hoping this will also help me find the things that I truly love and will wear over and over again. - **Save any extra income in investment accounts.** This way I will strictly enforce a budget for myself and am less tempted to withdraw money from these accounts, especially my 401k which I would have to pay a penalty for. - **Re-organize my closet and destash items I haven't worn recently.** I always feel like I can't find what I want to wear or I don't have anything to wear, yet my money continually disappears towards new clothes. Reorganizing my closet so I can find everything and shop my own closet will hopefully stop me from buying more things. I can also take this time to donate/ebay a bunch of items. - **Do more things other than shopping.** I haven't been too proactive in self-improvement recently and there are tons of things that I have been meaning to do like eating better and working out that have fallen to the wayside. I'll fill up the time I used to spend shopping on these activities. Hopefully these ideas also inspire you to stop shopping! I'll try to update you guys on my progress and more tips in the coming weeks. 
I really wanted to buy something special for my birthday... but I can't just pull the trigger. I feel like I'm failing if I do and it'll just send me on an endless spiral of regret and binge shopping again. After not doing any online shopping for so long, I spent the whole day window shopping online, at Luckyscent, Free People, Asos, For Love and Lemons, and currently lusting over my Sephora shopping cart at the moment, which includes the MUFE birthday freebie and some samples I really want to try out. Help me get through this! 
Posting as a throwaway, for obvious reasons. Mainly, because my husband and best friend both know my real reddit name. I have a problem. I really like clothes, and I love shopping. I shop at thrift stores, to neiman marcus to ebay to forever21 to bloomingdales to nordstrom. The thing is, I LOVE looking for bargins. And I get a "high" off of finding name brands, cute things, unique things, for CHEAP. I also worked as an estate cleaner for years--(it was my first job) and that's when all this started. Then I worked in a high end consignment store. And that's when the problem got out of control. In college, and since then--Id order on eBay. So much that I didn't even know what was coming. This still happens to. Sometimes, I can go periods of time without buying anything. And I'm doing better but then my health gets in the way. I have a chronic illness that causes tumors to progressively grow, and sometimes flair ups come from no where. And I'm bedridden, I live with my husband miles away from my family, and I have no friends here. It's been over 2 years, and I tried and tried and I just can't find anyone. So I shop as a cope techique. Basically so I'm not bored. Besides--I LOVE the rush of getting a new package, and ripping it open. And I love finding amazing deals at thrift stores, like a real Missoni dress for 4.95. I love using coupons, and finding the really cheap items at Bloomingdales. It's a rush. I find the glow of Neiman Marcus and Anthropolgie websites comforting. I'm sick. But now--I have tons of clothes. And I just need to stop spending money and buying clothes. (and other stuff). I'm probably more of a clothes hoarder as well. I love fashion and different outfits, but I have SO much clothing, even when I hire someone I can't keep up. 
Thank you to everyone who has subscribed! We now have flair that is self-assignable. Please be honest when assigning your own flair. * **No-buy**: you are trying not to buy anything non-essential * **Low-buy**: you are trying to buy very little non-essentials * **Budget**: trying to stay within a budget, but not cutting out too many non-essentials * **One Month**: succeeded in your goal for a month * **Three Months**: succeeded in your goal for three months * **Six Months**: succeeded in your goal for six months * **One Year**: succeeded in your goal for one year * **Ex-Shopaholic**: you no longer have a problem with shopping Please let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions for new flair! 
What do you need from everyone here? 
Hi, so thankful for this sub. I have been reading lately about minimalism and gratitude. Gratitude for what I have (especially non-material things) is motivating me to shop only for what I actually need, rather than trying to fill myself up with things I want. I have some debt to slog through, and I'm finally in a place where I can see it being paid off. Inspired by this sub, I am making my Christmas presents this year (and they won't suck). So grateful. 
I noticed that there are a few more members in our subreddit recently. There was also the comment about the sub not being very active. I would also like to improve the number of conversations started here, so I'm looking for y'all's feedback. **What would you like to see here? How can we facilitate more discussion?** I have tried weekly discussion threads in the past as well as monthly budget challenges, but those have not garnered much activity. What other ways can we make this a better community? Another concern of mine is that the flair for posts is not being used - should this be removed altogether? 
As I get older, I'm finding that my style is becoming more refined and buying sale items that I don't 100% love, I don't wear more than a couple times. Work wear and good quality items are becoming more important. I also have found the bag of my dreams... But it's $3000. So I'm vowing not to buy any items from now until my birthday in November so I can buy it. If I can't stop shopping right now, I might as well work towards more planned spending and long term goals, to eventually help me stop altogether. 
Hello everyone! Thank you all for sticking along for the ride. I'd like to introduce the new weekly discussion schedule. These are weekly recurring threads where we discuss a certain topic. Hopefully these will encourage you to discuss without having to post your own self post. * **Monday: Progress Update** How are you doing? Have you been meeting your goals recently? Share your progress and advice here! * **Thursday: Temptations** Temptation to shop often tests our determination to stick to our goals. Share any recent temptations that you've beaten (and tips how!), temptations that you're having difficulty with, and/or temptations that you submitted to. * **Saturday: Stash** This is a difficult part of the process, but realizing that we don't need all the things that we've previously bought and seriously taking a look at them is important to recovery. Share some things that you've found in your stash recently that you've been face-palming over and/or things that you're getting rid of and future plans to prevent unnecessary shopping. Hope you enjoy! Once again, any feedback or suggestions on these topics are welcome.

I spent a lot of money in the last month... I went a little crazy over looking for a new bag and bought a bunch of purses which I ended up returning. I'm still on the hunt but will be limiting myself to buying in store as I tend to spend less when I can see the price tag in person and have to go through the human process of checking out vs online where it's instantaneous and all my money is gone but I don't realize it until I look at my bank account later. Sorry for the rambling, just needed to get it off my chest. 
I think it's a toxic combination of three things: 1. My parents rarely ever bought me clothes in high school and college, and once I started a salaried job I could afford to properly build my wardrobe... Except I didn't stop. 2. I've always loved fashion, so it's hard to resist unique or interesting pieces. 3. Due to a chronic disease, my weight fluctuates between 120-180lbs, between size 6 and size 12... I frequently feel like my go-to items from last season don't fit right so I need to replace them. I'm finally ready to admit that compulsive shopping is a problem in my life. I don't want to keep this up and end up with serious financial problems. Just wanted to put this out there, it felt good to write it all out. I think my first step will be to go a month without shopping, cold turkey. Did this work for others out there? What was your first step? 
What sort of resolution are you making? 
I'm nervous to post this, but maybe it's an idea others could use. I recognized in myself a few things when it comes to my shopping addiction. I know it's from my anxiety and other mental issues. I often buy due to a fear of missing out - maybe missing out on a rare collector item, a limited release, a special sale or discount. I'm flat out of space to put things and I truly want less but I value my collection too much ; I feel my best option is to greatly reduce incoming items as I slowly reduce current items. But then here comes the anxiety. The voice telling me I'll miss out, it'll be gone, if I could just have THAT I'll be happy and fulfilled... So to help, I started a Tumblr. Whatever I see that gives me that creeping gotta have it anxiety, if it's in real life, I snap a picture. Online, save image/take a screenshot. It all gets posted to my Tumblr with where I found it, why I like it, and my comments on it. I post and then I tell myself to sit with the anxiety. Feel it. It's unpleasant but can't hurt me, not really. And I watch all the other people like, reblog, and comment. And suddenly, I'm ok again. That knot in my lower back is gone. My stomach doesn't feel sick. And I move on. I "bought" the item for my blog, and that's good enough. That makes me happy. And I'm amazed looking back at things thinking "wow, why was I so worked up over that one thing? Now it doesn't look so great ". Online window shopping this way is fun and social and if I have money left over at the end of the month, I go through my own personal catalogue to see if I want a treat! 
Don't know if any of you all believe in positive affirmations but I thought it would be helpful to try these out! You can start by saying them to yourself in the mirror every morning, paste these somewhere you'll see them every day, or try recording yourself saying them and play them back to yourself whenever you like. 1. I am a strong human being, I can do anything I put my mind to. I deserve to be free of my addiction to shopping. 2. I don't need to constantly shop to enjoy my life. 3. I have overcome my addiction to shopping so that I can stay in control of my budget. 4. I feel healthier now that I have stopped shopping compulsively. 5. I only need things that are healthy and satisfying in my life, I don't need to shop. 6. Overcoming my shopping addiction makes me feel more in tune with the world around me. 7. I am strong and in control of my cravings. I don't need compulsive shopping in my life. 8. Overcoming my addiction to shopping is a choice that I make daily. 9. I enjoy shopping now that I'm no longer addicted to it. I can shop a natural amount for the things that are essential in my life. 10. Today is the first day that I am no longer addicted to shopping addiction. 11. I enjoy feeling relaxed and in control of my shopping urges. I feel more at ease with myself when I don't shop. 12. Refusing to give into my urge to shop is a sign of maturity. 13. My body and mind feels more relaxed now that I'm not addicted to shopping anymore. I am in control of myself. 14. I set a good example for my friends and family by overcoming my addiction to shopping. 15. Now that I am not addicted to shopping I can make healthier choices in my day-to-day life. 16. I'm happy not to be addicted to shopping because I know that I am more mature than that. 17. Shopping doesn't make me happy. I don't need to shop to feel fulfilled. 18. I am in control of my habits. I have the strength to overcome my addiction to shopping. 19. I choose to spend my money on things that are essential to improving my life and the lives of my friends and family. 20. I have beaten my addiction to shopping. 21. My urge to shop is decreasing and I want to fill my days with more meaningful activities. 22. I am a role-model for others to be strong and break their bad habits. 23. My addiction doesn't control me, I control it. I am capable of overcoming my addiction to shopping. 
Welcome to our very first weekly discussion thread! Temptation to shop often tests our determination to stick to our goals. Share any recent temptations that you've beaten (and tips how!), temptations that you're having difficulty with, and/or temptations that you submitted to. 
I am currently on a one month no-buy and I have to say, I'm doing great right now. After the initial struggle (which was really hard, using internet for nothing else than windowshopping and making wishlists), I actually haven't bought anything frivolous for about 2 weeks now. I do still make lots of wishlist, but only for stuff that have a practical use. For example: anti-allergen stuff, new head for my electric toothbrush, etc. But I am holding off these purchases until I have enough money to actually buy them and not use my credit card. I even managed to gain a little extra money by selling off some used clothes. I hope to keep this up for at least two more weeks. Everyone else who's on a low-buy/no-buy, how's it going for you guys? Any advice? 
I can't stick to having a budget because I never follow suit. I don't plan ahead. I try to, but I never go along with plans. I'm always the guy who has no money when out with friends. I compulsively spend for instant gratification. I used to get everything I wanted as a kid. Well off dad. I dig into my food budget. Living with roommates now. 2nd week after getting paid am all out of funds. I constantly seek comfort. Easy life because of the things I buy saying things are a necessity. Transportation, ease of day, etc. mom is frustrated with me. I recently bought a tablet. Hopefully tablet and it's accessories are last parts of my shopping. If I saved all the money I've spent for comfort I'd always have money to hang out with my friends or eat out sometimes. Soda is a luxury for me because I can't afford to buy some right now. I will try this new no buy plan next month when I get paid. Wish me luck. 
Two weeks ago I'm ashamed to admit that I went on a bit of a shopping spree and bought about $800 worth of clothes. However these items weren't able to be delivered without a signature, and I left town for a 10-day vacation the day before two packages worth $600 came. UPS and FedEx only hold packages that aren't able to be delivered for 5 business days and I just got back today. While I'm a little disappointed I wasn't able to get the packages, I'm even more relieved that this mishap saved me money and prevented me from getting the spoils of my addictive habit. In addition, my vacation kept me busy sightseeing so I wasn't able to do any online shopping. It was a good break to reflect on my actions and strive to not make the same mistakes again. Have you been stopped from shopping by happy accident recently? Share in the comments below! 
Happy holidays to you all! Since our spending fast/diet challenge is winding down, I thought it would be a good time to introduce our next monthly challenge. This one is called the destash challenge, based on the popular minimalist challenge/game. See a previously completed challenge The rules are simple: On the first day you will get rid of one item. The second day, you will get rid of two items. And so on and so forth. The goal is to think about previous purchases, declutter your house, and I thought this would be great for the New Year. Every item you 'get rid of' will either be donated, sold, or thrown away. For /r/shoppingaddiction, I will add a 'reuse' option, as we're cutting down on shopping here, not necessarily things. And for our purposes, we'll be limiting this challenge to items that we have previously purchased (whether it be clothes, makeup, or anything else) and commenting on those purchases as well, to help our recovery process. At the end of this challenge, hopefully we'll have gone through 465 of our previously purchased items and be wiser too! I think this should be fun because we can share our items daily in either a weekly thread or separate posts by taking pictures of the things we're going through. Comments or suggestions to improve the rules are welcome. Also comment if you're interested in participating! Edit 12/27: I realized that 465 items might be too much for some people, so if you like, you can do a modified version of this challenge with either a) getting rid of 1 item a day for 30 items at the end of the month, or b) get rid of 1 item a day the first week, 2 items a day the second week, etc (with 5 items per day for last 3 days) for 85 items total. 
See original post ----- Please comment on this post if you are participating with: - * Which version of the challenge you are doing (full 465, 85, or 30) * The first item you are getting rid of today (picture in an imgur album or a bulleted list of the items) * What you are doing with the item (trash, sell, donate, or reuse) * Reflection on why you bought the item in the first place and what you will think about in the future before you make a purchase * **Items must be drawn from previous shopping binges** From here, you may either post as a separate thread for all of your own items (recommended if you are doing the 465) or continue to add to your original imgur album/list of items here. Let the destash begin! 
I know it's been a long time, but welcome back! Share your updates for your spending habits in the past month, good or bad below. Feel free to post a separate thread if you have a lot to say. 
Came across this article. A bit extreme, a bit dramatic, but this one man bares his story of his shopping addiction in a lengthy story. 
I am so happy that we have new readers! However, I would like to increase the number of posts that we have. How can we facilitate more discussion? Do you like the current weekly discussion thread? Do you have any suggestions for topics? I was thinking of switching out weekly discussion threads for a monthly challenge, such as not using credit cards or sticking to a limited budget for a month, then having a discussion about how everyone did at the end of the month. What do you guys think about this idea? As always any feedback or suggestions on any topic related to this subreddit are welcome. In addition for this month, a $5 Paypal credit will be given to a random person who comments with a **relevant suggestion or feedback** on this post! The deadline to comment will be 11/30 at midnight PST. A winner will be announced in this thread by 12/2. **12/2**: Winner is PetitOurs! You will be receiving a pm from me shortly. 
What are some items that you've been tempted to shop for recently? 
For those of you finishing your last minute holiday shopping, I saw these tips in an article recently and thought I'd share them with you! * Avoid online shopping, period. Block sites if you need to. Check out our list of browser extensions for blocking sites * Practice a 24-hour rule: No purchase can be made inside of a 24-hour “thinking” period. * Give your credit cards to a trusted friend, keeping only a debit card for daily necessities. * Find an alternative to a shopping expedition – make a plan to volunteer during the holidays or stay home and bake cookies for your neighbors. * If you must go shopping, take a buddy with you and give that person permission to question your purchases.
