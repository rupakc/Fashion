<1,0>	Hi Team, I have bought a levis jeans from your South ex (New Delhi) levis outlet with a name "West Wind Retails". I am highly disappointed with the quality of your jeans, this has never happened with me before and i am using your product since past 10-12 years. The jeans is getting worn out from thigh region within couple of hours of wearing it. Itâ€™s been just a week since purchased and have only wore once. I went to the outlet but their response has not been positive, i am not happy with the product and want replacement for the same. Details of the product: Bill Number: 10069 Customer complaint number from the outlet: 3485 Product Code from the bill: BNGWB- The Legging Ab Please revert
