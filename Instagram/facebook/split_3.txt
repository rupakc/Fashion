<1,-1>	Zara is one of my favorite stores. However, my first time experience of ordering online has not been good. In the latter part of June this year, I ordered a few items online. July 1st, I receive an email from Zara's customer service informing me that there was a problem with the shipment of my order and because of that they would waive the shipping costs. July 7 I email them back because I still had not received my order. They wrote me back saying that my order was in fact delivered on June 30. How can it be delivered on June 30 when I received an email on July 1st about a problem with the delivery. Does not add up. So I called up customer service today and was told that it was indeed delivered on June 30. I said I did not receive the package and was there anything they can do for me. The customer service agent offered to give me the tracking number and said I should call Fedex and bring the issue to them. I said is that the only thing you can help me with? I said if I bring this up with Fedex they will just insist that the package has been delivered and their responsibility has been met. This incident is really disappointing. I will not order online anymore. It is very frustrating.

<1,-1>	Hi! I'm hoping that I can get some help. About a month ago, I bought the Intimately Free Lila Maxi in preparation for my birthday (which was a few days ago). I always buy a special FP dress for my special day, it's one of my favorite traditions! Something that has been done for many years now. So, on my birthday a few days ago, I got the dress out to wear it for the first time--and, within three hours, the lace on the side was torn! It's a somewhat large tear that is noticeable. I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary that may cause a tear, and can't think of what could have caused it. Slightly devastating to have a $98 dress tear within the first few hours of being worn, especially on my birthday! If I go to my local FP store, would there be any way I could exchange it for a new, untorn dress?

<1,0>	[..] On the other side of Wanderlust, I definitely brought home a renewed confidence and self-awareness â€“ in my practice and in myself. Itâ€™s so easy to fall into doubt or awkwardness, but itâ€™s imperative we listen to our bodies, their physical and emotional needs, and truly welcome and celebrate those big victories and small successes. Thatâ€™s definitely something Iâ€™ve been able to find strength in, on and off my mat. - Free People
