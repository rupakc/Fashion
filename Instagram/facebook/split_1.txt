<1,-1>	I am really disappointed in your customer service. I ordered some pants and wore them once only to discover the seam on the right leg twists. I called your customer service line and was told to send them back, the pants would be "reviewed" and then I would "possibly" get an exchange. In the mean time I have to go without the pants I ordered. The option I was given was to buy the pants again. Or I was told I could wait a few days while "upper management" was contacted to see if the discount I had used could be reapplied to the pants I bought. I have already ordered the pants twice. I bought them on a Monday and on Wednesday received an email for 30% off. I called and asked if you could do a price adjustment since it was two days later. I was told no. So I bought the pants again at the discount and was going to send back the first pair. Why can't you empower your associates to help customers in the moment? I have always bought your pants from Nordstrom or Piperlime who have much better return policies and customer service. This is INCREDIBLY poor customer service.

<1,-1>	VERY UNHAPPY!! :-( the worst service ever! I paced a order over a week ago FA10076675, where you over charged me, sterling price instead of the euro price! I was never told that shipping from the uk there would be duties. when I was placing the order via the Euro/uk shite, I wasn't told Ireland had to pay duties. That was just 2 problems 1) being over charged to much money. over 100E to much is a lot of much, the dress was 270euor and you incorrectly charged me 250sterling, but difference.I can send you a screen shot of the price I if you want. 2) Duties ''I wouldn't mind paying if I knew from the start I had to. Moving on to trying to communicate with you. 3) I email and everyday someone else would tell me a very short answer, and never give me a full answer. 4) finally I got a email that was the worst ever, ''Your order is cancelled as the dress is not in STOCK'' after a 8 days of your keeping my 400euro. I am really sorry but this is just the worst service I have ever seen. You are definitely having international issues. I love your product. but how can you treat people like this after me spending time and giving you 400euro. I asked someone to call me to explain a few days ago. And they didn't even return my email. I am not just unhappy, I am mad at how you have treated me. I sent at least 8 emails most of them not even replies back, and if they were that were from people that seamed like them didn't really care. What do you have to say to all that??

<1,-1>	ordering in your store, I thought I will get only positive emotions. at the stage of ordering it was, but initially for the order I paid more money. after receiving the order, two pairs of three I did not match in size. the deadline I sent the shoes back and wrote of this support. the store received the parcel on 15 June, and promised to return dengel 3-5 working days. but not returned. my emails store does not respond for 10 days. money I will not return, and it is 160$. it so happened that in the midst of the season I was left without summer shoes and no money to buy it elsewhere. at the moment in the us discounts, but I can not buy anything, because I don't have the money for it. very hurtful situation, the store would not comment on its actions. I will address the issue differently and turn in all possible instances, and also in court.

<0,null>	Good evening guys! Sometimes in life we need to take a step back and reflect on things, reflect on ways and directions we want our lives to take, meditate on the importance of things and then let that reflect positively on the outside through our actions. Right, enough of that. There was a bit of colour blocking going on my end last Sunday and here is what I wore. Skirt ~ Marks & Spencer (Limited edition) Top ~ Matalan (old) Shoes ~ ZARA I must admit that I found these sandals quite comfortable and you won't catch me saying that often about most zara shoes. Have a lovely evening guys, talk to you soon xx

<1,-1>	Zara is quite a known brand but there are now quality issues. This is regarding leggings that i bought last month. After wearing it 2 times and then a wash made it so loose that i it slips down. Also the fitting because of which zara is trusted for has gone loose from knees which looks so bad. If this is the condition & quality of zara that after spending so much money i am getting this then it totally waste of my money. After wash (in normal temperature water) it looks like its so old as its fitting has gone, loose from waist, bulging knees. I sent an email regarding my problem but there isnt any reply yet. Hope to see an email in my inbox soon.

<1,-1>	I had purchased a top from Zara. I wanted to get it exchanged. Unfortunately I misplaced the bill. I was asked by the store manager to drop a mail with details to the customer care to get an â€œApprovalâ€? for this exchange. They said that I will receive a response within 48 hrs. From Friday 10-Jul-15 till date no one has responded to me. I followed up on the email, no response there, and then I called up the customer care office too and got no definite answer. This service is highly disappointing and not expected from a brand this big. Date of purchase: 5-Jul-15 Location of the store: Phoenix market city, Bangalore Mail sent to Customer care on: 10-Jul-15 Followed up on 13-Jul-15 Called the customer care office (0124 4973500) on 14-Jul-15 And today 15-Jul-15 I have heard absolutely nothing from anyone. I hope someone cares enough and would respond to me at least now.
