<1,-1>	Dear H & M I would like to draw your attention to the kind of service (or rather lack threof) I received at your store on the Istiklal street in Istanbul which I visited on 24.07.2015 (evening) while I was on a vacation there. I visited the said store with a friend. I picked up a pair of boxers which were on sale and were now for 10 Turkish Liras, while my friend picked up a pair of sunglasses and a similar pair of boxers. While waiting in the line we thought we would get the billing done separately so we lined up at the cash counter with my friend ahead of me. Once my friend got his billing done and I approached the counter to get my billing done, a man (a local) came and barged into the line and spoke to the girl at the cash counter in their local language(possibly Turkish). They both exchanged a giggle and the man conveniently handed his stuff to the girl at the counter to get his billing done. When I object to this, the girl across the counter, whilst ignoring my objection, kept billing his goods. In spite of being irritated by such behaviour, I decided to not say anything further and simply get my billing done. After getting the billing done, when me and my friend were leaving the store we were behind the same local man. When we reached the store exit, the said local man exited while the sirens started ringing when we came near the door. Embarrassingly, we checked our packets. Upon checking, we found that the girl at the counter had not removed the electric tags from the merchandise we had bought. I volunteered to go back and get them removed while my friend waited outside. Now, as I went back and requested the girl to remove the tags she ignored my request and kept billing. By now I was quite annoyed and I believe the other girl (cashier) at the counter saw that and told the first one to attend to me after which she finally did remove the tags. However, as soon as I came out and checked with my friend, I realised that the product I bought was supposed to be on sale and the cashier had billed it for 25 liras (actual price ) instead of 10 liras (sale price) . I had paid 50 Liras and I was supposed to get back 40 Liras as the boxers were on sale whereas i only got back 25 Liras. Visibly annoyed, I went back to the counter and requested the girl to give me the actual balance. To my utter disgust she again ignored my request and kept at whatever she was doing whilst other customers watch on. The second cashier girl, upon noticing the ignorant attitude being meted out to me by the first cashier called me at her counter and finally gave me my balance back. I have a copy of the said bill/receipt with me. As a regular H & M customer, I have been to your stores in Dubai, London and USA. However, I have not received such racially discriminating and annoying treatment anywhere. I do hope that you look into this seriously and take the said person to task to avoid tarnishing your image.

<1,-1>	VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER: I placed an order with you on the 26th of June paid in full and extra for express post shipping. I recieved a confirmation that it had been shipped however it never arrived, when i contacted Free people in relation to this I was told my my order was lost in transit and my express postage would be refunded (which it has not). I was then told that my order will be re shipped in 1-2 days. It took me to contact you, it would have been good practice to let me know what had happened. As the garments i had ordered were for an extremely important photo shoot my own business was conducting, leaving me to have to rechedule dates. Then I receieve this email from you......... this email is in reference to your recent order. Unfortunately, we were unable to process your order, as we could not obtain an authorization from your credit card company. You may wish to contact the issuing bank of your credit card regarding this matter, and then inform us of any additional information. We will hold your order for 48 hours, before it will be cancelled. Please respond quickly; merchandise cannot be held for your order and may become unavailable. For fastest results, please call us at the customer service number available on our website. Monday through Friday, 8 am to 8 pm, EST and a representative will be happy to assist you with this order. ????????? Why would you be trying to charge my credit car again, when my order was already paid for? Then tell me i should contact my bank ( Which i knew i did not need to ) AND then say you will hold my order for 48 hours before cancelling it????? WELL HOW KIND OF YOU TO HOLD AN ORDER I PAID IN FULL FOR! I responded to your email straight away after checking my bank receipts to find out i was infact charged the amount of $1,400 AUD and aking why you would be trying to take more money from me?? NO ONE has responded to any of my emails, I have now sent 5 in total asking for someone to contact me to tell me what is happening? After recieving no form of communication and living in Australia makes the time difference difficult for me to call, I actually got up ridiculously early today so that i could reach you. When i spoke to your representitive, she did not empathise with me in anyway and simply told me it had not been shipped as i owed 4 cents??????? Are you kidding I owe you 4 cents?? so you were holding my $1,400 order???? and not bothering to contact me in regards to this. When i purchase through a website it tells me how much i have to pay and it also takes the payment automatically from my card???? In actual fact my order was only $1,037.38 yet you took $1,400? but want another 4 cents? Your sales representative told me there was a glitch in your website and does this, so she credited the standard postage so the order could be sent out, however i paid EXPRESS post shipping, which she could no longer see due to the other sales person removing it in an earlier email? CONFUSED? ME TOO! I still do not know if my order has even been sent. and the person i spoke to was not even slightly compassionate over the phone. I am baffled at the lack of care and communications with your customers and let me tell you what a shame that is as i would have been a returning customer time and time again. I now will NOT be. I also wander how many other people this has happened too. Terrible service! If someone could bother to verify if my order has now been shipped that would be great, not holding my breath for a reply.

<1,-1>	Can you help me resolve a complaint? I have bought a bunch of 7 jeans over the years, but recently I bought a pair of jeans online and the fly is defective. It just falls down constantly, rendering the pants unwearable. My wife took them to a 7 store at Somerset Mall in Michigan and, despite having the receipt and the tag still on the pants, the store was unwilling to replace them and treated my wife poorly. This is how you lose customers. Please make this right!
