<1,-1>	I wear only Levi's denims... So I decided to gift myself Levi's this Diwali. We purchased clothing worth 8K plus from Levi's, Viviana mall... I totally forgot about my Levi's Loop card and cashier at the store never bothered asking for it. When I went for some alteration work after 2 weeks I suddenly remembered that I have a Levi's Loop membership. I requested the store manager to add my 8K purchase points to my loop card and he said it cannot be done now as billing system is online... That was the dumbest excuse given by someone. Guys at Hypercity also add points later if you don't carry the card and don't recollect your membership number. Is only customer responsible to get these points added? There is no responsibility on cashier's part? On top of that they simply forgot to alter my jeans. When I went to collect it, they gave reasons like machine wasn't working etc. They had my number but did not bother informing me about it. Didn't expect such a thing from Levi's... Totally disappointed...

<1,-1>	Kind Attn.: Customer Care Manager, Zara Dear Sir I have had a very poor incident where Zara Jaipur has vanished 4 denims/trousers purchased from them. After over 2 months of regularly following up with them, they say they cannot do anything about it. Following is the chain of events: a) On 3 Jan 2015, I purchased One Denims & One black trousers from Zara Jaipur. Copy of bill attached. b) On 11 Jan 2015, I purchased TWO Trousers (with belt ones). Unfortunately I do not have the bill. Time of purchase was between 1:30 pm and 2:30 pm. On same day I asked for Alteration service of these FOUR pants at Zara Jaipur counter. I was told that Sale is going on, so we cannot do alteration during sale. And they asked me to come after 14 Jan 2015. c) On 17 Jan 2015, I came to Zara Store again with all FOUR pants for alteration. I came in between 5:30 to 7pm. At Alteration counter, the sales person asked me to fill my contact details on one receipt which I did. Then he said he needs to make 4 receipts for 4 pants, and this will take some time (As there was lot of rush). I went around the store with my family for other shopping. Then I went after 15 mins again, but still he said it will take more time to make 4 receipts and asked me to come after 15 more mins. d) Eventually I had an emergency for which I had to rush at some place, and since I was short on time, I could not go back to Zara for collecting receipts. e) On 22 Jan 2015, I came asking for my FOUR pants, and they said they dont know anything about it!! They may have gone back to the shelves. How can they put back pants which are already sold back to the shelves???? f) On every visit of mine to Zara Jaipur, they kept telling me they are checking, half of the times the one or the other manager was not there. I am tired of following up. I have paid over Rs 10 thousand for these FOUR pants which I don't even have. I expect a solution for a reputed brand like ZARA. Either give me my pants or refund me the money. Regards Shivam Talwar +91-9929444222

You never sent me the return label even though I have made a return request 3 weeks ago and when i called your customer service they say i am past the deadline. Even though my request was made in time and YOU are the one who didnt provide me with the label to return my order. Thank you Zara i will make sure never to buy online from you again. You should take you sister brands as an example. I buy from Pull an Bear all the time and never had an issue with them.

<1,-1>	I had bought several cloths on June 20th. Roday I went to return some of them and they refused it. Store manager said today is after 30 days and she didnt accept to return or even exchange them. This is THE MOST REDICOLOUS POLICY I'VE HEARD. It doesnt make sence that you count both the day that I bought and the day that I return and say its over 30 days. I bought them on June 20th and made sure to return them on 20th. Even if its past for one day, MANAGER CAN NOT GIVE ME A STORE CREDIT? THIS IS THE WORSTE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND RETURN POLICY I'VE EVER SEEN. IN THIS I WOULD NEVER SET FOOT IN A ZARA STORE EVER.
